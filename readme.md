Final Project for Martin, Katherine and Zach

Title: The Search for Value in Wines in the US and France and the Relative Price / Rating Relationship Using Data Made Available by Wine Enthusiast Magazine. 

Project Goals: 
1)  Determine if Californian wine represents a better value than French wine using price data and wine ratings.
2)  Predict wine price with region / subregion and rating data.

Specifically, compare price versus rating for both Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon / Bordeaux Red Wine Blends.

Answer the following questions:
Is there a clear value winner?
Does rating level change the answer?
Is it possible to predict wine prices from these reviews?
Does region or sub-region matter?
From a wine review perspective, what words are more likely to be used as rating increase?
