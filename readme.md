Final Project for Martin, Katherine and Zach

Title: The Search for Value in Wines in the US and France and the Relative Price / Rating Relationship Using Data Made Available by Wine Enthusiast Magazine. 

Project Goals: 
1)  Determine if Californian wine represents a better value than French wine using price data and wine ratings.
2)  Predict wine price with region / subregion and rating data.

	Specifically, compare price versus rating for both Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon / Bordeaux Red Wine 	Blends.

	Answer the following questions:
	Is there a clear value winner?
	Does rating level change the answer?
	Is it possible to predict wine prices from these reviews?
	What is the impact of region and subregion on pricing and rating?
	From a wine review perspective, what words are more likely to be used as rating increase?
