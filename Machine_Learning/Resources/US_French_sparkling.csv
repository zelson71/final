This is a supple, beautiful wine, virtually orange in color, a fact that hints at its earthy, autumnal palate impression.

If the key to Heidsieck's Pinot-Chard blends is ""richness,"" it's ""crispness"" for this blanc des blancs.

A full range of caramel, floral, citrus, forest floor, mustard greens and dried cherry aromas and flavors work in great harmony. The mouthfeel displays a positive, brilliant tension: it's full-yet light, bright and zingy-but even, smooth, yet to some tasters, almost gravelly-textured. Lengthy, lime-tinged, the tight, almost austere finish bodes a great, long life ahead for this still-youthful 1988.","Clos du Mesnil Blanc de Blancs Brut","370","95","Champagne","Champagne","Krug 1988 Clos du Mesnil Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/krug-1988-clos-mesnil-blanc-blancs-brut-chardonnay-champagne/","Chardonnay","1988","Krug"

The bubbles are really tiny, giving the wine a silky mouthfeel, while the flavors are forward in raspberries and cherries, with a yeasty tang. As dry as the wine is, it shows a rich vein of honey on the finish. Drink now through 2010.","DVX Rosé","65","94","California","Napa","Mumm Napa 2001 DVX Rosé Sparkling (Napa Valley)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/mumm-napa-2001-dvx-rose-sparkling-napa-valley/","Sparkling Blend","2001","Mumm Napa"
"133083","12.5","Sparkling","US","Just about half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir, with a touch of Pinot Meunier, this fruit-forward bubbly  tastes sweet, even by California sparkling wine standards. It's almost what the French call demi-sec, with sugared lemon mousse and raspberry-vanilla cream flavors.","Vintage Brut","32","84","California","Sonoma","J Vineyards &amp; Winery 2002 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Russian River Valley)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/j-winery-2002-vintage-brut-sparkling-sonoma-russian-river-valley/","Sparkling Blend","2002","J Vineyards &amp; Winery"
"133226","13.5","Sparkling","US","Yes, it's sparkling Syrah, made famous by the Aussies. As dark as a red wine, it's so deliciously aromatic in cherry pie, chocolate fudge and caramel scents, it makes your mouth water. Once in that mouth, it has the dry effervescence of a sparkling wine, with the weight of, well, Syrah. A curiosity, but a good one.","Black Bubbles Syrah","16","90","California","Lake County","Steele 2003 Black Bubbles Syrah Syrah (Lake County)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/steele-2003-black-bubbles-syrah-shiraz-syrah-syrah-mendocino-lake-counties-lake-county/","Syrah","2003","Steele"
"133674","12.5","Sparkling","US","Absolutely, compulsively delicious. Totally a California-style bubbly, it's dazzlingly rich in cherry, raspberry, brioche, vanilla and spice flavors, with crisply sharp acids for balance, and a satisfying dosage for softness. Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc.","Brut Rosé","25","93","California","Central Coast","Laetitia NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Arroyo Grande Valley)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/laetitia-nv-brut-rose-sparkling-central-coast-arroyo-grande-valley/","Sparkling Blend",NULL,"Laetitia"
"133799","12.5","Sparkling","US","Mainly Pinot Noir, with 15% Chardonnay, this pale pink bubbly is impressive for ripe raspberry-cherry flavors, with a polished edge of bread dough and smoky vanilla. It's quite a delicious rosé sparkler, finishing dry and elegant.","Blanc de Noirs","19","89","California","Napa","Mumm Napa NV Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (Napa Valley)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/mumm-napa-nv-blanc-de-noirs-sparkling-napa-valley-70926/","Sparkling Blend",NULL,"Mumm Napa"
"133817","12","Sparkling","US","This is quite a good sparkler; a great price especially for a Chard-Pinot Noir blend from a major appellation that has spent eight years on the lees. Dry and creamy, it has mouthfilling, yeasty, raspberry-strawberry and vanilla-spice flavors, boosted with a honeyed dosage.","Lot 25 Sparkling Wine","18","90","California","Napa-Sonoma","Cameron Hughes 1998 Lot 25 Sparkling Wine Sparkling (Carneros)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/cameron-hughes-1998-lot-25-sparkling-wine-napa-sonoma-carneros/","Sparkling Blend","1998","Cameron Hughes"
"133819","12.4","Sparkling","US","Another year, another near-perfect brut rosé from Korbel. So dry and balanced, so layered, with yummy raspberry, vanilla, smoke and yeasty dough flavors, it's just irresistable.","Brut Rosé","11","90","California","California Other","Korbel NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (California)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/korbel-nv-brut-rose-sparkling-california-68483/","Sparkling Blend",NULL,"Korbel"
"134026","12.2","Sparkling","US","Almost 100% Chardonnay, this bubbly shows a gorgeous elegance and dry sophistication. It's all taffeta and silk, so light and airy, so drinkable. With subtle hints of lime custard, bread dough, lees and vanilla, it's one of the best blanc de blancs of this year. Drink now through 2010.","Le Rêve","65","93","California","Napa-Sonoma","Domaine Carneros 2000 Le Rêve Sparkling (Carneros)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-carneros-2000-le-reve-sparkling-napa-sonoma-carneros/","Sparkling Blend","2000","Domaine Carneros"
"134036","12.8","Sparkling","US","This 100% Chardonnay is easily the best Schramsberg blanc de blancs to date. It's so rich and luxurious in subtle lime, peach and brioche flavors, and so refined in its beautiful silky mouthfeel, and so long in the finish, you can't help but love it. Gorgeous now, and should hold and even improve for the next six to eight years.","Blanc de Blancs","35","94","California","North Coast","Schramsberg 2003 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (North Coast)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/schramsberg-2003-blanc-blancs-sparkling-north-coast/","Sparkling Blend","2003","Schramsberg"
"134149","12","Sparkling","US","Not the winery's best bubbly, as it's on the rough, sandpapery side. A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it has cherry, yeast and smoky vanilla flavors, and finishes dry.","Cuvée de la Pompadour Brut Rosé","35","84","California","Napa-Sonoma","Domaine Carneros NV Cuvée de la Pompadour Brut Rosé Sparkling (Carneros)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-carneros-nv-cuvee-de-la-pompadour-brut-rose-sparkling-carneros-70000/","Sparkling Blend",NULL,"Domaine Carneros"
"134209","12","Sparkling","US","The winery's brut has been a remarkably consistent wine over many years, offering plenty of real Champagne quality at a relatively affordable price. The '03 is dry, crisp and clean, with a fine, silky mouthfeel. It's also subtle, with suggestions of limes, cherries, brioche and toast.","Brut Cuvée","25","90","California","Napa-Sonoma","Domaine Carneros 2003 Brut Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros)","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-carneros-2003-brut-cuvee-sparkling-napa-sonoma-carneros/","Sparkling Blend","2003","Domaine Carneros"
