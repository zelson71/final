description
"Predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine shows a wonderful black-currant purity on the palate, along with intense, vibrant acidity. The background is all tannin, which speaks to its aging potential. This wine is the last vintage produced by Paul Pontallier, who was general manager from 1990 until his death in 2016. It's a memorable wine and one for aging. Drink from 2027."
"Almost black in color, this stunning wine is gorgeous, rich and dense. It's grand and powerful, with a strong sense of its own importance. The beautiful tannins and the fragrant black currant fruits are palpable. It's a great wine, with huge potential."
"This is a great vintage from Lafite. The profile is rich in feel, with a seriously firm tannic structure. Solid, complex and with great authority, this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant wine is impressively dense in dark-fruit tones. It will age for many years. Drink from 2027, although that would almost be too soon."
"A great wine, the summation of a great vintage in Bordeaux. The core of richness, the dense, bone-dry tannins, the black currants, red berries and black plum skins are the elements, but it's the way they have been integrated that makes this such an impressive wine. There is great elegance as well, a fabulous counterpoint to such power. Cellar for at least 15 years, but this will keep forever. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates and multiple U.S. importers."
"This is like drinking liquid black currants and blackberries. The wine has great intensity and richness from the superbly generous Merlot. The wood aging shows as a hint in the background, with the bold black fruit and ample acidity dominating. Drink from 2026."
"As so often, Pétrus has the ability to charm and impress, to seduce and overwhelm. This 2005, one of the greatest vintages from this great chateau, is massive and concentrated, with flavors of ripe black figs, chocolate and dark plums. Put that all together and the result is the utmost deliciousness, freshness and elegance. A major wine. Imported by Etablissements Jean-Pierre Moueix."
"This is the finest Cheval Blanc for many years. It is, quite simply, magnificent. The wine shows the greatness of Cabernet Franc in the vintage, with 57% of the variety in the blend. It is beautifully structured and perfumed, with velvety tannins, balanced acidity and swathes of black-currant and black-cherry fruits. It's well on course to becoming a legendary wine."
"Made with 45% Cabernet Franc, this great wine offers a beautiful, rich and perfumed character. It was an exceptional vintage for the estate, which incorporated fruit from parcels of the vineyard that would normally be used for the chateau's second wine into this blend. It is packed with black-fruit flavors and broad tannins, with a background of juicy acidity and a firm structure. Drink from 2027."
"This magnificent wine brings together the great fruit of the vintage in a complex structure. The acidity, ripe tannins and power of this dense wine are enormous, as is its aging potential. With that acidity and tannic structure, and with the perfumes from the Cabernet Franc, this wine will evolve slowly and with a measured pace. Drink from 2028."
"A hugely powerful wine, full of dark, brooding tannins. It's a wine for seriously long-term aging, a sculptural vision of classic Bordeaux structure with with classy, ripe blackberry fruits. It has fresh acidity and an immense full-bodied character, cut through with mineral acidity. A great wine, with great potential."
"This is a magnificently solid wine, initially even a bit severe. At this young stage, the tannins dominate, but it's also full of black fruit notes. Very dense and concentrated, this is a wine that's even better than the legendary 2005. The structure tells of its extraordinary aging potential: don't even attempt to drink this for 10 years."
"Perhaps of all the first growths in the totally un-classic 2000, this retains most of the classic Bordeaux. It is certainly almost black in color, while the new wood flavors are very present. But it shows an impressive restraint, leaving the power of the wine to be revealed over the years rather than immediately. This could well be the longest-lived of the Pauillac first growths."
"A big, powerful wine that sums up the richness of the vintage. It is densely fruity, spicy with an enormous black plum and berry fruit character to go with the acidity. It's concentrated while still showing such wonderfully pure fruit. The aging potential is immense."
"This wine is initially dense, almost thick enough to be cut with a knife. But then it becomes apparent that this is beautifully integrated and balanced, bringing together power, with the hallmark Lafite style and poise. In the end, you have a wine that promises an impressive aging potential along with delicious black currant fruits, acidity and a layer of striking tannins. Imported by Domaines Barons de Rothschild and multiple U.S. importers."
"A beautiful wine, with the firmest tannins surrounded by perfumed fruit. It is dense, of course, but this density is balanced with great elegance, blackberry fruits, sweetness and final juicy acidity. The wine is structured, a powerhouse of concentration while preserving this complete style."
"A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured."
"This is such an expressive wine, with elegance a major factor in its character. It is certainly huge, rich and dense. But there is much more to it. You can peel layers of fruit and tannins away, and still never get to the end of the wine's complexity. At every stage of its life, it will reveal a new character, but for now it is dominated by powerful tannins and huge, black, fruit."
This is one of the great successes of this vintage. It is generous and rich while also solid and structured. The combination of the essence of black currant and the elegant tannic structure are superb. This is a wine for serious aging and the wine should not be broached before 2026.
"A big, virile wine, dominated by dark and firm tannins. The structure comes from powerful black fruits, the wood only showing as dry edge to the tannins. It's firm, obviously destined for long aging, with initial blackberry fruits powering through the density. A stupendous wine that will last many decades."
"While the first impression with Pétrus is the wood, it is the fruit which gradually shows itself. It is extraordinary, this dense fruit, which simultaneously manages to float with elegance. There is layer after layer of fruit, sometime black, sometimes smoky, sometimes spicy. The wine is not yet totally integrated, still intensely young, with decades to go. But what a development it will be"
"Forget all those garage wines, forget the upstarts of Saint-Emilion. When you want real class, you have to turn to Ausone. What a wine - magnificently dense and opaque, hugely rich and sensual. Yet it doesn't seem in the least decadent - for deep inside the wine is a huge backbone of ripe tannins. Keep for at least 10 years"
"Almost entirely Cabernet Franc, this single-vineyard wine has a wonderful perfumed character. Firm tannins are fully integrated into the fruit, giving a structured yet balanced feel. Ripe and elegant, it will age well. Drink from 2027."
"Since the first vintage in 1991, this wine and its vineyard have travelled far. Now close to the top of the classification tree in Saint-Émilion, this vintage shows the impressive nature of this powerful wine. With a good balance between acidity and black fruits backed up by tannins, the wine is powerful and stylish. Drink from 2027."
"A wine of architectural strength and classical proportions, this has straight lines that mark the packed, concentrated fruits, which are sustained by its tannins. This is certainly the best wine that Léoville-Poyferré has produced, sumptuous while so finely structured."
"A beautifully structured wine, with its tannins layered between the ripest black plums, damsons and black currants. It is opulent while remaining dense, concentrated and very serious. Certainly a wine for long-term aging."
"A major success of the vintage. The wine exhibits extreme richness of the fruit, with all its sweet blackberry flavors. It also has underlying firm structure, density and solid tannins. Bring in the acidity at the end, and this is both impressive and ready for long-term aging."
"""For me, this vintage is what makes Margaux special,"" says Margaux winemaker Paul Pontallier. He is right: With its denseness, spice, flavors of black currants layered with dryness and fresh acidity, this is a huge and impressive wine that never forgets that it is Margaux. It is still young, and the dry tannic aftertaste, which lasts for many minutes, shows this."
"There is a sense of pure juicy black-currant fruit that shoots through this great wine. With tannins that are firm while not a jot too much, the wine is crisp, packed with fruit and set for many years of aging. It is beautiful, fruity and intensely structured. Drink from 2027."
"It's easy to call this a beautiful wine-it's dense and lush, with great layers of black fruit and acidity. The first fully biodynamic vintage from this estate has certainly yielded impressive ripe fruit, with structured tannins and dark berry flavors that linger long. It has enormous potential, certainly not be ready to drink before 2027."
"This is a splendid wine. Yes, it is more powerful than the usual aristocratic Lafites,  but it still manages to retain a special air of great elegance and presence. The fruits are black, the tannins immensely powerful, the flavors are of black figs, dates, cocoa. At the end, there is a vibrant acidity that shows through, which promises a great life for this great wine. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"With its distinctive antique bottle and gold etched label dominated by a sheep, this is definitely a move away from classic Bordeaux bottling. It is good that the wine can support the presentation. The fruit is so ripe, it almost tastes of raisins, but that sweetness is finely balanced by the dry tannins and concentrated texture. To finish, there are exotic spices, giving an almost oriental character to the long aftertaste."
"This is a major wine. It has enormous tension, structure and a core of dark tannins. Amid all this, the wine is also packed with fruit and concentrated blackberry and black-plum flavors. It will age slowly and steadily with its enormous structure and concentration. Drink this wine from 2027."
"This is a beautifully opulent wine, great Mouton in its richness and succulent fruits. It's combines structure and obvious new-wood aging with hugely ripe black plum and currant flavors. While it is a pleasure to taste now, there is a great tannic structure in the background to give the sense of power and aging potential. Drink from 2024."
"Big tannins and impressive fruits are the hallmarks of this impressive wine. It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure. For this fruity vintage, it shows a strong sense of direct, solid structure, only allowing the strong black plum and berry flavors to come through slowly. It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later."
"With seriously dense tannins, this shows great structure. Rich and full of ripe fruit, it also has a fresh streak that gives it a lift. The structure will allow the wine to age over many years while the fruit and acidity will give it crispness. Drink this impressive wine from 2027."
"Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit. Black fruits, coffee, very concentrated flavors, a powerhouse of structure and richness. The warmth of the wine is palpable, as is the aging potential."
"Direct and concentrated, this wine is powered by tannins and a firm texture. Dense, it has the potential for plenty of fruit as it matures. That will take time, because this impressive wine is powered by its structure. Wait until 2028."
"Dark and dense, but with such opulent fruit, this is a year when La Mission shows its softer, richer side by comparison with neighbor Haut-Brion. There is spice and exotic and generous red fruits to give with the concentration. It has great power, but it also has a velvet structure."
"Denis Durantou's obsessive search for perfection paid off handsomely with this stunning 2000. Despite the richness of the fruit, there is still a sense of lightness to the wine which makes it surprisingly easy to comprehend at this stage. The Cabernet Franc perfumes couterpoint the rich Merlot, while the wood underpins everything."
"This is a rich, finely structured wine. It is highly perfumed, packed with black fruits and has a dark, firm texture. At the same time, the acidity is intense and the structure tight, suggesting a wine to age. Beautifully endowed with great fruit, it will take time to develop. Drink from 2026."
"This extravagantly perfumed wine has great juicy, ripe fruits. The tannic structure is almost secondary in the welter of ripe fruits, but it is enough to promise aging. Acidity and rich fruitiness partner each other to give a wine that is both fresh and powerful. Drink from 2020."
"This is a beautifully crafted, structured wine. From its ripe black-currant fruits through the acidity and tense tannins, to the full, generous aftertaste, the wine impresses. It has great fruit, balanced acidity and a good potential. Drink from 2025."
"From its privileged position on the sweep of vines leading up to the medieveal city of Saint-Émilion, this estate has made an impressive wine in this vintage. It is rich and concentrated both in its structure and its black fruits. Complex, dark and dense, it can age for many years. Drink from 2026."
"In 2000, it seems the Cabernet Franc made Cheval Blanc. It has given a mysterious, wonderful perfume to the intense richness of the Merlot. It has less of the explosive power of Ausone, it is more subtle and elegant, reserving its explosion of richness for the end, when a welter of black fruits seems to go on for ever"
"Effectively half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is a tremendous wine. With very fine tannins, spice from a touch of wood and swathes of ripe fruits give this wine its concentration and its huge potential. The wine has weight and a dark, dense structure that will allow it to age for many years. Drink from 2027."
The classic blend for Figeac with its 32% of Cabernet Sauvignon and 28% Cabernet Franc gives a beautifully dense wine with great tannins. The wine is perfumed while the complex tannins are finely cushioned by the generous black fruits and acidity. It is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2026.
"This grand wine is stylish and elegant. It is also powerful and dense with dark tannins and great concentration. It is a very fine wine, packed with black plum and berry fruits and balanced richness. Don't let the great fruit deceive: this is a wine for the serious long term. Drink from 2028."
"Combining power with great elegance, this wine displays superripe, rich fruits that are restrained by velvet tannins and the delicious perfumed character from Cabernet Franc in the blend. Juicy, rich, structured, it's a beautiful wine with a great future. Drink from 2020."
"A very concentrated wine with such a stylish feel. It balances ripe berry fruits with chocolate and wood flavors in the richest, ripest combination. The wine has power, without losing its poised character. It's ready for long aging."
"This estate, now performing on top form, has produced a rich, dense wine. Swathes of black fruits underline the generous structure and intensity. At first taste, the tannins are soft but that turns out to be an illusion. The tannins are just richly cushioned within the beautiful fruit. Drink from 2024."
"This is an immensely dense wine that is going to be a classic. The dark tannins are still lined with wood aging but that will go because the fruit underneath is also just as dense and intense. Blackberry, black plum and damson plum give power and sweetness. This is a great wine with huge potential. Drink from 2028."
"This is a very fine wine showing a new level of quality at Montrose. With its almost velvet tannins inside the intense black fruits, the wine is rich, smooth and generous. Blackberry and black-plum fruits are to the fore along with the fine acidity and great structure. A wine to age for decades, it will be ready to drink from 2027."
"This is an architectural wine, very classical in its structure like so many of the top wines of 2010. It's powered by ripe tannins and beautiful black currant fruits. While the wine is gorgeously ripe, it also has a powerful dark and structured character. For long-term aging."
"Saint-Estéphe has a reputation for tannins, and this 2005 Cos lives up to that. But it does much more, because the tannins add richness along with intensely ripe black fruits, dark plums and figs. The dense tannins are finely balanced with fresh acidity, and a long-lasting aftertaste. Impressive."
"This is a great wine. It has all the elements in place to produce a wine that will last for years: powerful fruit, rich tannins and a structure that is built to last. This is elegant, impressive and concentrated. Almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, the grape gives the wine its fruit and its tannins. Drink from 2028."
"Power and elegance merge effortlessly in this superb wine. Its pure black currant fruit is tightly coiled, supported by just the right amount of firm tannins. Great aging potential. A triumph."
"A classic in development, a wine that will last for decades. It is certainly powerful, but already the shape is finalized, with its plums and berries settling down with perfumes, acidity, just enough tannins and a warm, welcoming richness. A great argument for the superiority of 2001 over 2000."
"For an Haut-Brion, this is huge. Every characteristic suggests power, from the dark color, through the knock-out perfumes, full of dark, brooding fruits. The flavors are black, intense and ripe. It is a delicious wine, surprisingly ready to drink. And yes, just at the end, there is a small hint of the delicacy and elegance that is true Haut-Brion."
"This may be from the exceptional vintage of 2003, but Château Margaux remains true to form. First and foremost, it is a refined, elegant wine, with complex layers of flavors. But, yes, the hot summer is there the dense, dry tannins, but somehow they seem to float through the wine rather than sitting heavily in the middle. Acidity and freshness come to finish, giving the wine a delicious lift. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This rich wine is full of fruit and structured with layers of tannin. It's also stylish and elegant, with a suave texture that is already attractive. Black fruits mix with the structure to give a wine that will age well. Drink from 2026."
"Structure is the watchword for this wine. With dark tannins and concentration, it obviously has long-term potential. At the same time, the black-currant fruits are ripe and full bodied, giving rich contrast to the tannins. These two elements will allow this wine to age. It will be ready to drink from 2025."
"This is a powerful wine, with wood aging that adds richness to the dense tannins. Some tough extraction has not detracted from the ripe fruit or structure and will go as the wine matures. It should be ready to drink from 2026."
"Madame de Lencquesaing's estate has produced a stunner in 2000. The perfumes, delicate and sensuous, give it class, style and make it very memorable. It is delicious now, but there are tannins there, and deep, intense fruit flavors, waiting to develop slowly and surely."
"This is a finely structured wine with dark tannins and intense black fruits. The estate, with its biodynamically grown fruit, has given an impressively pure wine, packed with tight serious tannins and a fine structure of black-plum skins and intense acidity. It is direct, firm and with a huge potential over many years. Drink from 2027."
"The label of this vintage is designed by David Hockney in memory of Philippine de Rothschild. It is a powerful wine in the rich style of Mouton with strong black-currant fruits from 81% Cabernet Sauvignon. It is dense and dark, ready to age for many years. Drink this impressive wine from 2026."
"This generous, almost opulent wine has both concentration and rounded fruits. It's open already, hinting at wood-aging while concentrating much more on the ripe fruits. Packed with fruit and tannins, it's densely textured. It will age, of course; don't start to drink before 2025."
"Showing the serious side of Lafite, this is big and dark, powered by tannins as much as fruit. The wood aging is still showing, although that will integrate into the great structure that holds up the ripe black currant fruits. Totally dominated by some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Bordeaux, this wine has strength while also having great freshness. Drink from 2024."
"So smooth, this is a rich, grandiose wine. Although it is full of black currant fruits and spice flavors, the texture is most impressive. Dusty tannins are integrated with juicy fruits seamlessly. The purest fruit flavors are allied to linear tannins in a precise yet generous way. The wine is evolving beautifully, but do not drink before 2020."
"The wine shows the power typical of a Lafite but within the context of the fruity 2011 vintage. The immensely dense tannic structure gives the wine a solid feel that is lifted by so much ripe black currant and berry fruits. At the back, the wine has a more brooding, dark character that suggests great aging potential. Drink this wine from 2019."
"With a structure that runs between acidity and dark smoky tannins, this is a wine with potential opulence. It's very rich in character, dense and dark. The black plum flavors are dominant, along with excellent acidity. For the long-term."
"The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated."
"A dense, immense, solidly powerful wine. The ripest fruit overflows, paralleling the dark, solid tannins. As so often, Lynch-Bages is a blockbuster, dark and concentrated, with immense aging potential."
"This is the new taste for this estate: richly endowed while remaining elegant and suave. Certainly, there is great concentration here as well as rich black fruits. But they are given a sense of style and poise that will remain with this wine as it ages. Drink from 2026."
"This vintage was ideal for the rich style that this estate has made its own. This wine is full bodied and ripe with black-currant and dark berry fruits. The tannins fall into the cushioned wine with ease and richness. Of course, the wine should be aged, so wait until 2026."
"Classic Lynch-Bages with just a bit of extra power and richness. While the tannins are structured, it is the velvety fruit that rolls around the mouth that is the most dominant character. It is coming together into a wine that will be big and dense, but never over the top."
"A great, classic Pauillac, with its dark, dense, almost black currant flavors stirred together with immense tannins. The layers of dryness, fresh fruits, acidity and ripeness are all coming together into a magnificent structure. Age for at least 20 years."
"This is a powerful wine, made to age for a long time, from this estate which is performing in top gear. Complex tannins and dark fruits both make their presence felt. It has weight, ripeness and a dense structure. A great success, it is unlikely to be ready to drink before 2027."
"This is closed up, dry and tough on the outside. But you can feel the rich weight and the dark tannins along with the powerful structure. That makes this wine both replete with a firm character and also full of generous, concentrated black fruits. It's a powerful wine, ready for good aging; drink from 2022."
"Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year."
"Full of black-currant flavor, this firm wine has structure and a rich texture. Its bolstering tannins and vibrant acidity mark out an age-worthy selection. Spice tones and a dry core set the stage for a slow development into an even more complex and fulfilling wine. Drink from 2025."
"This wine is dense in expressive, dark fruit and solid tannins which give it a rich, enveloping feel. With its spicy score and crisp acidity, there is great potential for aging. Drink from 2025."
"This wine, rich and opulent, defines the terroir of this estate. It has a rich, dense character, powerful and concentrated. The juicy black fruits enhance the impression of generosity as well as concentration. Drink from 2027."
"This is likely to be one of the most long-lived Pomerol from 2000. It has hugely rich fruit, it is has great density. But what will give it its longevity is the layer of tannin that sits, brooding, in the middle of the wine. Don't even attempt to drink before 2012."
"The wine is a velvet glove in an iron fist. The smooth surface of ripe fruits and rich blackberry flavors, masks the dense tannins that will allow this very great wine to age for many, many years. The acidity and the rich fruit combine with the fine dusty tannins. The wine will surely not be ready to drink before 2027."
"A complex wine, exhibiting smoky tannins, rich fruit, a dark texture and concentration. Produced by the Moueix winemaking team, it feels complete with its sense of style and elegance as well as weight. Give this powerful wine many years in the cellar."
"Beneath the surface tannins is great Merlot fruit, very ripe and full-bodied, a powerhouse of flavors. The depth and complexity of the wine is all there, along with a dark core of dryness. A wine for long-term aging."
"Certainly it is firm, with impressive power. But the smoothness of the ripe black fruits as they combine with the beautifully judged wood show a contrast of tension with the dense, chewy core. At its heart, this wine is dark and solid and concentrated, promising long aging."
"In keeping with the new style from this estate, this is a powerful, opulent wine. Its density, concentration and layers of dark fruits are all of a piece, held together by powerful tannins. Touches of black coffee and spice emphasize the richness of the fruit and the opulent aftertaste. Drink from 2025."
"This estate always produces serious wines, but with this vintage it has added a layer of sumptuous fruit that enhances the complex, dark profile. A strong texture and concentrated tannins are balanced by the juicy black-currant flavors and powerful aftertaste. Drink from 2026."
"This wine is superb. With its power and structure it will age over 20 years or more. Backed by blackcurrant and jelly flavors, it shows great fruity attractiveness even at this early stage in its development. It will develop slowly and evenly to become a reference point for the vintage."
"With the amalgamation of Château Magdelaine into this one property, the estate is now a considerable 58 acres. The wine is now performing in top gear. Powerful tannins drive the mainly Merlot blend with 10% Cabernet Franc. It still shows signs of the wood aging and these will disappear to leave a richly endowed wine with a fine future. Drink from 2026."
"Here's an impressive wine that is so ripe and with great structure. It is a major wine with a dark complex texture and the finest acidity. The wine is very complete, all the elements in place from the black fruits to the tannins to the hints of wood aging. Now at the top of the tree in Saint-Emilion's classification, the wine will take years to mature. Drink from 2027."
"This almost 100% Cabernet Franc single-vineyard wine is perfumed and ripe. The velvet tannins and ripe black fruits are fine, structured and with enormous potential. The wine is generous, opulent and worthy of serious aging. Drink from 2027."
"With its high proportion of Cabernet Franc (45%), this is a finely perfumed rich wine. It has great tannins, a smoky character that comes from the wood. The tannins are quite marked, giving a tight firm edge to the wine that otherwise has generous fruitiness. This is a complex wine, impressive, and likely to age over many years. Drink from 2028."
"Minty new wood aromas on a wine that shows both great tannins and sweet wood. The fruit is still to show, but promises fresh plum flavors that will be delicious and juicy. This is a ripe, concentrated wine."
"A ripe year like 2009 is kind to the Cabernet Sauvignon of Château Figeac. The wine is perfumed with new wood and sweet fruits, delicious black currant flavors giving both ripeness and freshness. The wine has weight and impressive density. A star of the vintage."
"This wine is packed with ripe black fruit and structured by a dense, mineral texture. Generous fruit tones and plenty of tannic grip translate to a wine worthy of the cellar. Drink from 2025."
"This family-owned property at one of the high points in Saint-Émilion has made a rich, opulent wine, full of perfumed Cabernet Franc and generous Merlot. Ripe blackberries and dark plums are permeated with some serious tannins for aging. Drink this powerful wine from 2025."
This is an impressive wine that transcends the problems of the vintage. It has rich fruit that is sustained by the tannic structure that rests on a bed of fresh blackberry fruits cut with fresh acidity. The wine will certainly age well. Don't think about drinking it before 2024.
"Firm and structured, this beautifully concentrated wine has plenty of the dark tannins that come out of Cabernet Sauvignon in Saint-Estéphe while allowing room for juicy fruit. The wood aging is still showing, giving some spice to the wine. At the end, it's the density of the wine that's so impressive. Drink from 2024."
"Enormous tannins, dominant black fruit and a solid, dense structure. The wine, packed with dark fruits, dry tannins, very firm in character. With its huge tannins as well as fruit, this is a wine that really needs many years of aging."
"This sumptuous, powerful wine has a great sense of structure and tannins. It is also overwhelmingly dense with black fruits and swathes of rich black currants. In this vintage, even more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual in the blend has given a ripe wine set for a far-distant future. Drink from 2026."
"While this wine is rich, it has a classical demeanor, with fine tannins that support but never dominate the ripe black fruits. Full of juicy acidity, it offers black currants and some fine, firm tannins at the end. This will take some time to mature, and the wine will not be ready to drink before 2027."
"Right from the early days of tasting in spring 2001, this was going to be one of the stars of the vintage. And a star it remains. There is big, ripe fruit, with solid, ageworthy tannins. It may not be as powerful as some of the blockbusters of the vintage, but it is certainly more opulent, less classical than Léoville-Barton can sometimes be."
"This powerful wine has a superb mix of the crispest fruit and great structure. Blackberries and black currants shine through the tannins, expressing the liveliness of the vintage. It is so well delineated with everything in its place. The wine is certainly going to age for decades. Drink from 2027."
"This combines considerable power and concentration with rich, impressive fruits. It has both style and elegance, with density to give it great aging potential. The tannins are firm while also having a velvet texture. The wine, dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, is for serious aging. Drink from 2025."
"Huge structure, huge potential, a wine that will bring out all the fruit and density of the vintage while remaining very fresh. Black plums are already showing strongly along with the dry core that promises aging. It's serious while alive and bright. Drink this major wine from 2022."
"An immensely structured wine, packed with dark tannins promising aging potential. It is complex, powerful, layered with new wood and concentration, finishing with dark plum fruits and acidity."
"A dense, beautifully structured wine. It shows intense, ripe fruit with balanced acidity. It's the fine tannins that give it such class, surrounding the fruit, promising long aging. This is a classic for Léoville-Barton."
"A wonderfully firm, concentrated wine that walks a fine, balanced line between richness and poised structure. It is classic in the best sense, showing all the shape of a fine Bordeaux, while adding the extra dimension of the freshest of black fruits, complexity from a few hints of wood, and a dark, brooding, long-lasting aftertaste."
"Almost black in color. Hugely rich, ripe bouquet with dark fruits. A hint of tobacco, plus structured tannins and acidity give the wine shape. The richness and depth of fruit are here, but so also is the ability to age. Give this 10 years before matruity."
"It may have had a few winemaking controversies in recent years, but Giscours is now on a roll, under the ownership of Dutch businessman Eric Albada Jelgersma. How good it is, is shown in the 2001 wine, which is generous, almost opulent, rich and dense. Despite the richness, though, this is still Bordeaux: Dry tannins, tarry black-fruit flavors and firmness place the wine definitely at the table."
"This is a complete wine, full of both tannins and great swathes of ripe fruit. It has a serious side as well in its solid structure and concentration. The juicy blackberry fruits are beginning to calm down and meld into a fine dense wine that will age very well. Drink from 2025."
"Still dry and concentrated and with swathes of rich tannins, the wine is dark and dense. The undertow of ripe black fruit is impressive. It obviously has considerable aging potential, Drink this serious wine from 2025."
"This is a full-bodied wine, from one of the leading estates in Margaux. It is ripe with juicy blackberry and black-currant fruits. This fruit contrasts with the dark tannins and powerful structure. It is going to develop slowly and impressively to be ready to drink from 2025."
"This wine is smooth, ripe with fine tannins and red plum and black-currant fruits that are soft and gentle. Acidity dominates at this stage, supported by the tannins. It brings out the fruit and freshness of the year while also keeping some structure from the high percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink from 2025."
"A serious and concentrated wine that is one of the stars of the vintage. With its tight tannins and a considerable sense of structure, it shows a dark and dense side. It's full in the mouth, black plum skins and intense acidity giving a lilt of freshness at the end. Drink from 2019."
"A solidly structured wine, it is both elegant and intensely powerful. It is disclosing its fruitiness slowly, at the moment dense and concentrated. A restrained edge provides complexity and balance. It will need aging, so don't drink before 2022."
"Dark and structured, this is a firm wine. It has a smoky wood character, powerful tannins over intensely ripe fruit. Acidity and sweetness balance to give a dense wine, powered with richness and destined to age for many years."
"A rich and opulent wine, very ripe, packed with luscious blackberry and damson fruit as well as sweet tannins. It is a fruit salad of fruit flavors given structure by a core of dryness. Already a gorgeous wine, but one that will also age."
"There is a tough, tannic core to this otherwise ripe and fruity wine. All to the good, as this will allow the bold, ripe wine to age well. Black-currant fruits are already showing their hand and will intensify, bringing in richness and a dense texture. Drink this wine from 2025."
"This is a perfumed wine, rich in black currants and acidity as well as firm tannins. It is concentrated and dense while also elegant. The aftertaste boosts the ripe fruit and balanced acidity. Drink from 2025."
"This chateau gets better and better. The wine has power, but it is harnessed by the intense fruits, the blackberry flavors, the density and the wood. With the power, though, comes elegance, resulting in a wine that is ready to develop over many years."
"Typical of Lynch-Bages in its sumptuous rich style, this is a resounding success for the team of Jean-Michel Cazes. With its sweet fruit, opulent but balanced wood and red and black fruit flavors, it is a wine that will develop relatively quickly but will certainly age."
"Fragrant and perfumed, this wine is the epitome of great Cabernet Sauvignon. It is fruity, juicy yet with serious concentrated tannins. There is spice from the wood aging along with a dash of pepper, all the while just bringing out the beautiful black-currant flavors. Drink this wine from 2024"
"This is rich, while also such a stylish wine. It is ripe and full of tannins while masking that firm structure with immensely generous fruit. The two give the wine power, density and elegance. Drink this impressive wine from 2025."
"This wine is rich, with generous black plum and berry fruits. It has a structure that is full, ripe and that will sustain the fruitiness of the wine over many years. The sensation is of velvet, with some force behind it. This remarkable wine will develop well over the medium term and then age for many years. Drink from 2022."
"There is a lightness about this vintage of Mouton Rothschild. It doesn't take away from its quality but does give the wine poise and an attractive lift. The wine is based on solid tannins, then the ripe fruit builds layers of fruitiness and freshness. It is not likely to be one of the longest-aging Moutons, but it will be delicious. Drink from 2020."
"This is a solid, concentrated wine from a reliable chateau. It has weight and power, with rich black fruits balanced with fresh acidity. Touches of bitter extraction and wood aging are likely to integrate as the wine ages. It should develop into an impressive and powerful wine. Drink from 2018."
"94-96. Barrel sample. Like so many wines in this vintage, this shows black-currant acidity. It's lively and fruity, with the firm tannins providing a counterpoint."
"A seductive wine, deliciously ripe with the softest, juiciest fruit over smoky new wood. The wine shows intense fruit as well as a soft Merlot core. The tannins are beautifully integrated in this ripely sweet wine."
"Mint aromas hint at the wood, but more important is the massive Merlot fruit that is an essential element in the blend. The result is a wine that blends richness and power with an initially severe character. Slowly it opens to reveal opulent blackberry jam flavors, immensely ripe."
"Smooth, with dense tannins hidden behind the ripe, pure fruit, this important wine shows class and an impeccable balance of fruit and tannin. Rich as well as structured, this is a beautiful wine."
"The wood element is important here, but it is based on a firm Cabernet Sauvignon structure, dry but rich tannins. The wine is a great success for the vintage, giving sweetness, ripe fruit that only shows light extraction, and dark plum and berry flavors. The feeling is of polished fruit and wood, rounded but always dense."
"A big and powerful wine, with tannins that are compact and dense. The dryness of the tannins go right to the core, surrounded by chocolate, sweet fruit and dark berry flavors. The wine is well structured, big and bold, with plenty of firmness promising aging."
"Richly endowed, the wine is beautifully concentrated. Still young it has considerable potential with its rich fruits and firm tannins. There is a strongly juicy aftertaste that brings in the freshness of the year. The wine will age well, and should not be drunk before 2026."
Initial tight acidity in this crisp wine gives way to smooth rich black fruits. This already has a fine balance with its ripe juiciness and delicious red-berry flavors. It is going to develop into a very fine wine. Drink from 2024.
"The wine is powered both by its tannins and by its great fruit. Dark and dense both in the structure and the black-plum flavors, it is very fine wine- juicy and ripe. This is a serious wine with a great future. Drink from 2026."
"Tight tannins mask the ripe fruit in a wine that is set for long-term aging, so there is a dry core that dominates at the moment. But not for long: the bold black fruits are insistent and are going to be delicious. This is a structured wine that will be ready in 2026."
"This wine is structured with impressively ripe fruit. Black-plum juice and blackberries are balanced with a strong tannic content that gives the wine backbone and structure. It has weight, although with its already exuberant fruitiness, it is not likely to be really long-term wine. Drink from 2024. From 120 acres, only the best grapes go into this top wine and 2013 was a smaller crop than the average (10,000 to 12,000 cases). Believed to be the oldest of the five Bordeaux first growths, Haut-Brion has been in the Clarence Dillon family since 1935. The current president is Prince Robert de Luxembourg."
"A powerful and complex wine from an estate performing on its top form. Solid tannins, layers of wood and dark fruits combine to give a wine that offers both richness and a dense structure. This Haut-Bailly should age impressively and for many years."
"Smooth and opulent, this immediately appeals with its generous fruit and texture that feels like velvet. The structure sits under the seductive surface, with a chocolate wood flavor, fruit tannins and density. Age for over 10 years at least."
"Dominating aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the toasty flavor that covers the fruit at this stage. But, like all 2009s, this is a rich wine that will balance out and show all of its opulence. That said, it will likely always be a firm, ageworthy wine, with the dark tannins always in evidence."
"This wine is ripe, rich and generous. It brings out the almost-sweet character of the fruit in this vintage. At the same time, the tannins are firm and support all this fruitiness. The wine will develop well. Drink from 2024."
"This is a wine with great balance and elegance as well as richness. With layers of fine dusty tannins it has a warm character that is repeated in the perfumed fruit and juicy acidity. The wine is impressive, likely to age well. Drink from 2024."
This is a powerfully structured wine from a 18-acre property on the plateau of Pomerol. Rich Merlot dominates and gives the wine both its alcohol and its intense tannins and juicy red fruits. The wine is dense with the potential for aging over a considerable time. Drink from 2025.
"This wine is ripe, juicy and already showing its concentration and depth. It showcases the fruit of the year, deliciously fresh while having a velvet tannic structure. The acidity will continue to keep the wine fresh, allowing the structure to develop slowly. It sings with great fruit and good potential. Drink from 2022."
"A majestic wine, grand in every sense. It has weight, the firmest of tannins and an immense sense of structure. This neighbor of Château Pétrus is firmly dense, showing both the fruits and the tannins in balance. Give this wine at least 10 years in the cellar."
"Impressively weighty wine, with a fine combination of tannins, full fruit and a solid, chunky core. The wine is rich, but it also has a sweet acidity. Powerful ageworthy wine, never losing sight of elegance."
"Everything is here in this great wine. The solid fruit flavors are of black berries and dried raisins, and there is a rich, powerful structure. Above all, it is finely balanced. It shows that a wine can be powerful without being high alcohol."
"This powerful ripe wine has firm tannins that are so well integrated. With acidity and with rich black fruit, the wine is concentrated and dense. From a small parcel on the slope of Saint-Emilion, it is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2026."
"Smoky aromas and layers of tannin and fruit give this wine great complexity. It is smooth, juicy and fresh while also having perfumed tannins and an elegant, lightly mineral structure from the Cabernet Franc. The wine's cherries and red berries are still encased in the structure, allowing it to develop slowly. Drink from 2024."
"This is a grandiose wine with impressive dark tannins and swathes of black plum fruits. A hint of licorice and dark chocolate lies over the brooding, firm texture. Expect such a concentrated, solid and serious wine to age well. Drink from 2019."
"This is a magnificent wine with an opulent structure and a finely perfumed character. It is dense with the ripest black fruits cushioned by the soft texture. A serious, denser side brings out a tannic core. It's elegant while also powerful and certainly needs to age. Drink from 2024."
"A parcel of almost 100% Cabernet Franc gives this perfumed, classy wine. It's very structured, mineral-textured and darkly dense. Powerful and concentrated, this intense wine will develop into a major statement. Drink from 2019."
"This is an opulent, dense wine, very perfumed while also structured. It is complex, full of rich fruit that pours through the wood and dark tannin. It just hints at a more exuberant future, flavored with the ripest fruits while still keeping freshness. Drink from 2020."
"This powerful wine comes from a superbly sited vineyard in the heart of Saint-Emilion. It is concentrated with huge tannins laced with black plum juice, dark berries and a dense, brooding character. A powerhouse of both fruit and tannin, it needs to age. Drink from 2018."
"Clos Fourtet is a continuing success. This 2011 is both rich and seriously structured. Ripe, with a mineral character, it starts firm and then shows generous blackberry fruits. Still young, it should not be drunk before 2018."
"This is a big and smoky wine that's very concentrated. It shows both the power and the structure of the vintage, as well as balances fresh, fragrant fruit. Dry tannins and the dusty texture are finely integrated into a wine that layers wood, intense acidity and great long-term potential."
"A big, complex wine from this continually improving property, this is now performing at its classed-growth level with concentrated ripe berry fruits and chocolate flavors. The wood aging is still showing through and needs time to integrate better, but as it does, this will be a great wine."
"This is a perfumed wine, dominated by Cabernet Franc. Black fruits are layered with wood, dry tannins and a beautiful aromatic quality. The wine is deep and complex, built for the long term with its power, density and considerable elegance."
"With its superripe, jammy fruit, this is lush and opulent. It does have a fine structure as well as bitter chocolate and dark tannins. A hugely powerful wine."
"Elegant as well as rich, this is a beautiful wine. It has great depth of flavor, the sweetest fruit, deliciously ripe. At the same time, the tannins are an underlying sustenance to the impressive ageworthiness."
"A gorgeously perfumed wine, dominated by the ripest Cabernet Franc, combining richness and an intense structure. With its tannins, it will age well over many years. The fruit is finely textured, deliciously juicy, showing the most complex series of flavors."
"One of the peculiarities of St.-Émilion's classification is that Canon la Gaffeliére is not classed in the top rung. Because, as this wine shows, it produces superb wines. This is ripe while so elegant, with great intensity and sweet perfumes."
"Hugely dense, foursquare wine with great fruit and the purest tannins. Chocolate and coffee predominate at the same time as sweet tannins and acidity. A wine that combines charm with great power."
"While there is certainly plenty of wood here, the wine has weight and impressive concentration for the year. The tannins are still brooding away, giving a dark firm character to the wine. Blackberry fruits and acidity are there, but still well buried in the tannins."
"This powerful wine has great structure, fine and elegant tannins, and ripe black fruits. It wears its heart on its sleeve. The concentration doesn't take away from the juicy fruit and wealth of complex flavors. A wine with a great future, it won't be ready to drink before 2026."
"An aristocratic, perfumed wine dominated by delicious Cabernet Franc. Beneath this elegant exterior, there is also power from intensely concentrated fruit and tannins. The wine is already well integrated, the wood only here by feel, balancing so well with the fruit. To finish, sweet fruit and dusty tannins combine easily."
"With its aromas of new wood, spice and black fruits, this promises from the start to be a powerful, polished wine. It is dense, very ripe (from the high percentage of Merlot in the blend), but still packed with tannins. It's a massive wine, bringing together the heat of 2003 with the big tannins of Saint-Estéphe. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Thought by many tasters to be the wine of the vintage at the time of the 2004 barrel tastings. Has it retained that status? It is certainly a hugely powerful wine, monumental even. It is also finely balanced, with great dark tannins working in partnership with brooding black fruit. The question is whether it is too big, too powerful: only time will tell. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This is a beautifully perfumed wine. With a high proportion of ripe Cabernet Franc, it is not only structured but has a fine dried fruit character that gives the wine a memorable richness. The wine is tight with its tannins, likely to age over decades. Drink from 2027."
"This wine has so many of the structural elements of a Saint-Estéphe, but also is enveloped by ripe fruitiness. Black in color and dense in character, it has sweetness from the plum juice fruits and great acidity. But it is also firm, powerfully projecting a serious potential. Drink from 2022."
"With its perfumed aromas, this is a wine that has richness and sweetness, with soft velvet power. It has an intense wood element that needs to blend into the rest of the wine, but the sweet black currant and freshness provide a good balance. This is a seductive wine, with a fine solid character."
"A sinuous line of tannins runs through this structured wine. It lifts the dark plum and berry fruits and give shape to the spicy, firm wine. As the estate builds in strength, the style of this perfumed, stylish wine will be seen as a benchmark. Drink from 2025."
"Cos d'Estournel has softened those austere Saint-Estéphe tannins and produced a wine that is all opulence and roundness. The tannins are certainly there, but they come through as big, bold richness. The power suggests it will age well, but for drinking earlier, the freshness of the sweet homemade plum jam promises well."
"Somehow Barton has overcome the heat of the 2003 vintage and has come out with a new wine that is rich and elegant. There are generous tannins, ripe black currant fruits, balancing acidity, all in an ensemble that is so much more than the sum of its parts. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Here is a huge ripe and luxurious wine, with great power. The texture is solid, filled with firm tannins, the flavors are black and ripe. Along with the power, though, is much of the elegance and poise that characterizes great Saint-Julien."
"This wine, with its massive tannins and rich fruit, is obviously set for a long life. It does have the contrast of fresh black-currant acidity to give it a lift. But with the power behind it, the wine will develop slowly. Drink from 2025."
"This impressively powerful wine has dense tannins and concentration. With 74%  Cabernet Sauvignon, it is firm, packed with black-currant fruits with intense, perfumed acidity. Cabernet Franc adds spice to the wine. The wood aging is still showing and the wine will need several years before enjoying. Drink from 2025."
"Great swathes of fruit cross the tannic core in this impressive wine. Hints of wood aging peek out from beneath the sumptuous richness and spice. It is ripe, dense and obviously set for long aging. Drink from 2018."
"94-96. Barrel sample. This very ripe, full-bodied wine is powered by sweet blackberries and solid tannins. It is a full, concentrated and complex wine that has a great future."
"Very supple wine, with great richness and density. It is all so complete, a pleasure, powerful yet also with sweet opulent fruits layered with dark tannins. For long-term aging."
"This family-owned estate has produced a structured and dark wine with great concentration balanced by acidity and pure, creamy fruit. It is a wine with a good future. The aftertaste leaves juicy acidity and firm tannins. Drink from 2025."
"One of the furthest west of the Saint-Julien estates, this property has been greatly improved with investment from Japanese owner Suntory. The wine from 2015 is dense and impressively concentrated, perfumed black-currant fruits working well with the crisp acidity and solid structure. Drink from 2025."
"The ripe fruit that is a hallmark of this vintage at this estate has been maintained along with solid tannins and richness. This has both tannins and concentration although the fruit is the thing, making a wine that will develop relatively quickly. Drink from 2023."
"Sometimes seen as the junior of the two properties owned by the Barton family in Saint-Julien, this is an impressive estate in its own right, especially in this superripe, smoothly rich wine. Tannins are well wrapped in the generous structure and fruits. Drink from 2025."
"This elegant estate, with its views down to the Gironde estuary, has produced an excellent 2015. It is properly firm with tannins although this structure is well balanced with the ripe, stylish black-currant fruits and acidity. A juicy finish bodes well for the future. Drink this generous wine from 2025."
"This is opulent, but with restraint. The fruit is rich, black and delicious. Touches of spice and wood are present, lending complexity to the ripe fruits and balanced tannins. Impressive."
"This is a marvelously complete wine, with its impressive ripe fruit, shining through the open structure. It is firm, but not too much. Stone black fruits are just perfectly ripe. There is just a core of dryness to compliment the rest of the wine."
"The completeness of 2001, with its miraculous balance, is present in this wine. The acidity, ripe blackcurrants sit comfortably on top of dry tannins, the fleshiness of the fruit taking the edge off the tannins. It seems to bring out the structure, the fruit and the refreshing acidity of great Cabernet."
"A rich, open modern style of wine, full of new wood flavors. The fruit is solid, chunky and square, while the tannins are ripe and generous. This will develop relatively quickly, over the next 10 years."
"Huge, deep purple-black color, and aromas of rich, spicy fruit give a sense of great power to this superbly intense wine. Liquorice and rich tannins suggest complexity, while subtle acidity adds refinement."
"Sometimes it seems as if La Mission is as good as Haut-Brion - that was certainly the case in 2001. But in 2000, La Mission fitted more comfortably into its usual good neighbor slot. That is not to suggest it is not a great wine - the score indicates that. At the moment, it is closed, solid and chunky, but all the right hints are there, and it will develop slowly and in a sustained way over many years."
Dense tannins and rich black fruits mark this ripe wine that was organically grown. Its tannins are cushioned by the concentrated but generous black fruits giving the wine great purity as well as structure. Drink from 2024.
"With its usual high proportion of Merlot, Palmer 2003 was always going to be a generous, very ripe wine. And so it is proving, but what is so satisfying about the wine at this stage is that the great sweet fruit, which comes right out of the glass. Underneath, of course, there are tannins, so this wine could be drunk soon, and then aged for another 15 years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This is a great wine. The winemaking team, headed by chateau director John Kolasa, has taken advantage of the heat of 2003 and the fact that Rauzan-Ségla has a great vineyard. They have crafted a densely tannic wine that, at its heart, retains a cool elegance. There is great fruit, blackcurrants, and acidity which adds to the sense of poise with power. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"A huge, powerful, dense wine, which layers pure black fruits over dusty tannins. This is an impressive wine, proof of Rauzan-Ségla's improvements since Chanel took over ownership. It is packed with fruits, like an intense jelly, but also has dryness, acidity and good aging potential."
"To call Kirwan a rising star is no longer true, since this property, owned by the Schyler family, and with Michel Rolland as consultant, is now firmly back in its right quality place among classed growths. It is modern in style, as is expected, but the dark, black currant, extracted fruits, new wood and structure don't detract from its elegance."
"The renaissance of Kirwan, with the consultancy of Michel Rolland, continues with this ripe, forward, concentrated wine. The tannins are sweet and soft, with a solid, chunky structure that promises a long life. The finish displays balanced new wood flavors and a smooth polish."
"At this stage, this is very closed, very tight, giving little. But it is possible to discern that this is going to be a beautiful wine. There are flavors of sweet raisins and the fruit has a new world richness, but the structure of dry tannins is always present. It looks as though it has a good, long life."
"At first taste, this wine seems more new world than Bordeaux. But then the subtle, perfumed aromas and structured fruit show through, along with the clean acidity and black tannic fruits. Give this wine at least 12 years before opening."
Layers of black fruits and tight tannins set this wine on a serious road. It has the freshness of the vintage as well as the bright acidity. At the same time it is structured and dense. This second wine of Château Margaux is ripe and ethereal in its lift. Drink from 2024.
"While the wine from this major estate is dry at this stage, it is just covering for the juicy black-currant fruit. It is a finely crafted wine, firm and structured while preserving the great fruit of the vintage. With this balance, the wine will develop well. Drink from 2024."
"This is typical of the ripe and opulent style of this property with superripe black currant fruit. It's concentrated in flavor, but also structured with smooth tannins. It's a wine both for short-term fruitiness and long-term power and density. Drink from 2017."
"Cantenac Brown is on a roll now, and even in lesser vintages. This is a full, ripe wine packed with black currant flavor, but also structured with solid tannins. With a juicy acidity on the finish, and boosted by its dry core, it's certain to age well. Drink from 2018."
"Power and ripeness walk hand-in-hand with this major player. The wine is opulent and extracted with flavors of rich blackberry fruits, but shows a firmness in tannins and dense texture. Drink from 2018 and it's sure to be a great success."
"93-95. Barrel sample. This firm, dry wine is solidly rich and full in the mouth. With fine acidity and black currant fruit that show through the tannins, it is a wine with considerable potential."
"Warm and rounded, this spicy wine has wood flavors just showing through the ripe fruit. It is already delicious, with rich blackberry flavors right up front, although its aging potential is evident with the concentrated, deep structure."
"A dense wine, powerful while also elegant. It shows all the best character of a grand Margaux, with fine tannins as well as dense structure. It will age well."
"Showing the richness of the vintage behind firm tannins, this wine is tough and solid at the moment although that will change as it matures. The hint of bitter over-extraction is the sole blemish on a wine that otherwise highlights the many improvements at this estate. Drink from 2025."
"This is a ripe, juicy wine, showing the improvements at this potentially fine estate. Dense tannins and succulent fruit come together to give a wine that is both structured and complex. The black-currant and berry flavors are underlined with a ripe structure. Drink from 2024."
"From one of the most southerly of the Margaux vineyards, this attractively fruity wine is bright with black-currant flavors. Delicious acidity and layers of spice from wood aging promise a fine, ripe future."
"New wood, sweet fruit, blackberry and plum skin flavors are all here in this round, ripe wine, with its soft, dusty tannins and delicious fresh acidity. This property has certainly joined the big league in Margaux."
"The fruit has become the main attraction here-layers of ripeness, tempered with an elegant smoothness. The tannins are certainly present in this powerful wine, but they are here to lend support, not dominate. With herbs and very clean black fruits, this is a wine to follow."
"This wine is dominated by new wood, which goes right through the big, dark fruit flavors and tannins. Very ripe cassis flavors are under this wood, waiting likely for many years before the wood flavors subside. This is very much in the modern, polished style of Mouton today, made even more pronounced by the heat of  the 2003 vintage. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Considering the reputation of Lynch-Bages as a rich, polished wine, it is not surprising that, in 2003, the team of Jean-Michel Cazes and Daniel Lhose produced a superlatively ripe, opulent wine, one that could almost have come from Napa. But not quite: The fruit is compact and dense, with layers of acidity that speak more of  Bordeaux than California. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Normally one of the most elegant of Pauillacs, the 2003 is big and dense. These dark tannins mask delicious black fruit, flavors of spice and layers of acidity. This is going to develop relatively fast, despite the density of the wine, just because it is so rich. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"With its 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a wine that is structured while marked with intense black currants. It has firm tannins and just a touch of wood. It is classic upright Bordeaux with its fine acidity and dry tannins. It will need to age, drink from 2024."
"Warm and ripe, this is a beautifully balanced wine. It is packed with black-currant fruits that are bursting out of the glass. A darker side comes with the tannins and new wood flavors that are still prominent. It looks likely the wine will develop slowly, so don't drink before 2025."
"This marks an impressive step forward for this wine that's so often been in the shadows of other wines in the Lafite-Rothschild stable. It's dense and structured as well as deliciously fruity. The wine is straight down the line, starting with perfumed acidity and finishing with blackberry fruit. Intense and tannic, it's likely to age. Drink from 2020."
"Now firmly in its new cellars, Clerc-Milon's wine is performing at the top of its form. This is a dense wine with juicy acidity as well as sweet tannins and ripe blackberry fruits. They give a ripe wine that is finely structured. The juicy aftertaste, typical of this vintage, is appealing although it does not detract from its power and longevity. Drink from 2022."
"Continuing its impressive development, Clerc Milon 2011 is a serious wine. It is elegant, stylish, its fruits well integrated with red berry and plum skin flavors. Powerful while round and fruity with a fine sense of weight, this wine will develop relatively quickly but will then stay at its peak for many years. Drink from 2017."
"This estate continues to rise in quality, and this bottling is a serious and dense wine. It has obvious flavors of wood aging, but balanced with rich blackberry fruitiness. The texture is dark and concentrated. Drink from 2017."
"Don't be fooled by the easy fruitiness of this delicious wine, because underneath the blackberry flavors is a powerfully tannic structure. Opulent and dense, it promises considerable aging. Drink this complex wine from 2018."
"With advice from consultant and Bordeaux University professor Denis Dubourdieu, Batailley has improved immensely in the past few years. This 2010 reinforces that trend, revealing a wine that is structured with Cabernet Sauvignon and is attractive with black currant fruitiness. Age for the medium-term."
This wine continues the upward progression of Clerc-Milon. It has weight and density while also showing sweetness and delicious acidity. A very complete wine.
"This is a wine for aging. The tannins are dense, very dry with a feel of extraction. It takes a while for the black currant fruit to show through, with acidity and freshness dominant. The wine is still settling, and time will bring the fruit into line with the tannins."
"Slowly the potential of this impressive wine is coming out. It is rich, the new wood flavors blending with the ripe blackberry sweetness and tight tannins. Chocolate flavor power through this concentrated wine."
"For the year, this is a big wine, a success. New wood flavors and tannins blend well with the weight of fruit, depth of flavor and concentration. The wine has freshness to give with the structure, solid and intense. Certainly for aging-five years and more."
"This is one of the three biodynamic estates that are owned by Gonzague and Claire Lurton. The wine is generous while also firmly structured in the style of this property. A dense, dry core surrounded by blackberry and black-currant fruit promises great things. It finishes clean, clear and crisp. Drink from 2024."
"This is a vastly improved estate, making impressively good wines in recent vintages. The wine is structured and tannic but also packed with black-currant fruits, good acidity and spice. It will take time to develop, so drink from 2025 at the earliest."
"This generous, ripe wine is filled with fine tannins as well as juicy black-currant fruits. It is approachable in the sense that the fruit is so delicious. However, watch for those tannins that are firm and dense and will allow the wine to age. Best to wait until 2024."
"The success of this wine owes as much to Merlot as to Cabernet. The Merlot has created the ripeness and smoothness of the wine. While the Cabernet keeps it firm and closed up, there is a base of rich, sweet fruit here that will show over the next two years. The style of the wine is moving away from elegance to power under the new regime of owners, Champagne Roederer."
"Year after year, Lynch-Bages is able to produce sumptuous wines, typically rich, powerful and structured. This is solid, the blackberry ripe fruit enveloping this structure with a velvet sheen. This is developing into one of the successes of the vintage."
"From one of the major estates in Pessac-Léognan, this is a fine, stylish and tightly structured wine. It has spice and intense acidity to balance the dark tannins and black-currant fruit. It is going to need several years to really mature. The estate is owned by André Lurton who was influential in creating the Pessac-Léognan appellation. Drink from 2024."
"This is a tightly coiled wine, still firm and packed with tannins as well as fruit. It has a strong dry core that is lifted by the bright acidity. This is going to be a very complete wine, all the elements well in place. Drink from 2026."
"Ripe and richly fruity, the wine is full bodied with great acidity as well as firm tannins. It will keep for many years. Bold tannins and a fine tension between the fruit and acidity are all promising for the future. Drink this impressive wine from 2025."
"This wine is rich while at the same time having a stalky character that gives smokiness, texture and acidity. These combine with black-currant flavors that finish the wine with great freshness. It's a light vintage for this estate, fruity and certainly for the medium-term. Drink from 2020. The estate has been in the Dillon family since 1985."
"This wine has considerable potential, with rich tannins and firm fruits. It is solid, very dry at this stage although this is balanced by dark plum skin and blackberry flavors. The wine will develop slowly, so don't drink before 2022. The first harvest at this estate was in 1252. The property is now owned by Bernard Magrez, a wine, art, culture and gastronomy patron."
"Very firm and closed up, this wine is a tough proposition at the moment. It has the weight to develop well along with richness. Acidity, sweet fruits and concentrated tannins will all come through strongly as the wine matures. Drink from 2020."
"A serious wine, filled with firm tannins, spiced with wood, and layered with bitter coffee as well as fruit. It certainly has power, the structure ready for long aging, firmly anchored in the dense character of this wine. It is a medium aging wine, 5-10 years."
"Just on the edge of the urban sprawl of Bordeaux, this estate has managed to retain its vineyard despite the housing pressure. This year it is beautifully structured, dense and very stylish. Black-currant fruit, some firm tannins and balance make this wine so attractive. Drink from 2024."
"Initially toasty on the nose, this wine offers a pleasant black-fruit core which shows good  oak integration. Its juicy black-currant flavors are just beginning to show on the structured palate, and as it fills out, the flavors will be seamless. Drink from 2024."
"It is the power that is so evident in this wine - a full, up-front expression of Merlot at its most powerful. It is somewhat closed up at this stage, but it is going to continue its development as an enormous wine which still manages to keep its power under firm control."
"This is a wonderful, dense wine, very concentrated, very intensely flavored. At this stage of its development, it is the opulence which is most evident, but there are already hints that it will show pure fruit alongside sweet tannins, and will develop complexity."
This is a big wine in its breadth of flavors and structure. Powerful tannins give hints of the wood aging. The ripe black fruit is given a crisp edge by the acidity that is typical of the vintage. The wine will certainly age well. Drink from 2023.
"This is a small, 10-acre property, owned by the Moueix family, at the heart of the Pomerol plateau. With its 30% Cabernet Franc it is perfumed and ripe, giving delicious black fruits as well as a firmer structure. The wine is set for a long aging with great potential. Drink from 2024."
"This wine has a lot of class and elegance, along with firm tannins that show how well it will age. It is dark and concentrated, the black fruits still developing under the solid structure. This wine will age slowly, so wait until 2022."
"With a higher proportion of Merlot (92%) than usual, this is a round, ripe wine released at just 20% of normal production. The generous texture and tannins are well integrated into the rich fruit. It's juicy, broad and showing the typical acidity of the vintage. With its tannic structure, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020."
"Dense and complex, this powerful wine has impressive tannins and a solid structure. It does hold plenty of fruit, although at this stage you need to search for it. The character now is dark, dense and remote. It needs many years to bring out the rich black fruits and fresher acidity. Drink from 2024."
"Both rich and dense, this wine shows the ripeness of the Merlot in 2010. It has firm fruit, touches of dark chocolate and licorice. With its concentration, this small vineyard is now in good form, producing ageworthy wines."
"This rich, balanced wine comes from an estate that is performing in top gear. It is a generous wine, showing the luscious fruit of the vintage along with a good structure of dense tannins and layers of wood aging. Drink this ripe wine from 2024."
"Opulence and richness, with all the generosity of Merlot, are the hallmarks of this superb wine. It is huge and powerful and has enormous potential. What is so exceptional about this wine is that all its power is still to be revealed. In 10 years time, it will prove to be one of the stars of the vintage in Saint-Emilion."
"This rich wine has a good proportion (31%) of Cabernet Franc to give it a perfumed structured character. It is dense and with considerable tannins at this stage. By contrast, the fruit has enormous potential with rich blackberry and black-plum flavors. This chateau has made a considerable stride in this vintage. Drink from 2022."
"Tight and concentrated, this is a very fine wine. Great acidity and great tannins go with the most intense fruit. Blackberry and black-cherry flavors power through this structured wine. There is also elegance and a fine sense of style. Drink from 2025."
"Sophisticated and full of fruit, this wine combines the freshness of the year with great tension and structure. The juicy underlay will develop well over the next few years. It's complex and worth aging. Drink from 2024."
"Initially closed, this wine just hints at its richness and perfumed character. As it opens it shows still-young tannins and intense black plums and blueberries that will develop as the wine ages. It is likely to mature well over the medium to long term, and will not be ready to drink before 2022."
"With ripe, spicy fruit, this is a concentrated, dense wine. It has young, firm tannins that are beginning to integrate with the juicy black fruits and fine, perfumed acidity. This is a serious wine, showing how well this estate is developing even in a difficult year. Drink this from 2022."
"This wine is rich with jammy fruits and ripe acidity. Firm tannins are only just making a mark on the sweet, fleshy fruitiness. It revels in its concentrated fruit and in the dark tannins that are still at the back. This wine will certainly age, dense while always fresh and juicy at the end. Drink from 2022."
"This is a perfumed and generous wine with great tannins and a strong minerality. This is the first year that wines from the former Château Magdelaine were also included in Bélair as the two estates were amalgamated. It's dense, complex, balanced in character yet still with fruitiness of the vintage. Drink from 2024."
"Structured and firm, this is a dark chocolate and black fruit-driven wine with solid tannins and enormous density. It has a mineral texture with a dry core surrounded by juicy berry fruits. A powerful wine, it promises a long-term future. Drink from 2018."
"Firm and very structured, it has depth plus some spice from wood aging, along with a dry core that still dominates the fragrant red berry fruits. Don't drink before 2018."
"Austere and severe, this single-vineyard wine is very much a product of its limestone terroir. It has a mineral intensity that pushes through the tannins and black currant fruit, giving a powerful, dark character. Firm and structured, this is a wine for the long term."
"93-95. Barrel sample. A firm and tannic wine, it has the weight to support its tannins. It's balanced, solid and dense, with a powerful shot of black fruits."
"Fresh blackberry fruits give a smooth wine, rich and with an immediately attractive fresh acidity. It does have the density of fruit along with relatively soft tannins. At the back there is a more chocolate character."
"A ripe wine, very open and smooth. The tannins are dark, but it is the fruit-blackberry and red plums-that comes right through. Look beneath this charm, and there is also a wine with more structure, perfumed and ageworthy."
"A wine that shows structure, richness and warmth. It has such ripe black fruits with generous tannins, concentrated texture and acidity. It is melding into a floral, spicy, opulent whole."
"Straight down the line, this wine shows fruit and acidity. The tannins are relatively soft while the fruit is forward. Blackberries, coffee and licorice notes all come together."
"Very fruity aromas hint that this is a bright wine, its tannins shaded by the red and black berry flavors. The structure is integrated, showing ripe as well as fresh fruit with final flavors of chocolate."
"Smooth, perfumed and elegant, this Cabernet Franc-dominated wine has rounded tannins, layered acidity and a dark power of ripe tannins. It is both concentrated and fresh, a great combination."
"An impressive wine, beautifully structured, never too powerful, very elegant. If it feels a little austere at this stage, that is because the structure is dominating the fruit. Give it 5-6 years and the full splendor will be revealed."
"This wine is dense with superripe tannins. It has rich black-plum and berry fruits along with an opulent texture typical of this wine in good vintages. Along with its power, the wine has great acidity to keep the aftertaste crisp and fruity. Drink from 2024."
"This structured wine also offers juicy, elegant fruit. Full of black plums, spice from judicious wood aging and acidity, its core remains to develop. The wine needs to age so drink after 2024."
"This rich and generous Grand Cru Classé is full of dark fruit and tannins and is ready to drink. It has weight, juicy acidity and black plum and berry flavors. Ripe, with the perfume of Cabernet Franc, it's entering maturity now and should very drinkable until at least 2025."
"Although it begins with austerity, its acidity and tannins dominant,  the palate opens beyond its youthfulness after a few moments. It becomes dark and powerful, certainly still dryly tannic, but the fruit is generous, and the final taste is of beautiful, ripe fruits."
"Dark-hued and concentrated, this wine also has a considerable mineral character, along with intense bitter chocolate and dark plum skin flavors. It's juicy, but also broody, massive and dominated by its solid tannins. Keep for 5-10 years."
"A powerfully velvety wine, which still packs a walloping punch of Saint-Estéphe tannins. The fruit, under these tannins, is pure, ripe, black and generous. But there is the proper dryness that shows how the team at Calon-Ségur managed to tame some of the excesses of the 2003 vintage. This will develop, slowly, into a great wine. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"For a Saint-Estéphe this is surprisingly supple at this stage. The density is all in the exotic fruit, while the tannins are more of a background. That suggests this is a wine that will develop relatively fast, but it is going to give great pleasure along the way."
The initial wood flavors in this wine rapidly give way to rich fruit. Spice and black-plum flavors are built by a firmly tannic superstructure. The aftertaste brings out the acidity. This wine should develop well over the long term. Drink from 2023.
"Powered by its structure and texture, this complex wine is dense, structured and firm. Plenty of dry and taut tannins dominate at this stage, but it is also full of fruit. The wine will age over many years while not being one of those vintages that will mature forever: the fruitiness will see to that. Drink this impressive wine from 2025."
"This is one of the vintages from Cos that seems to pull out all the stops. The fruit is so rich, the texture so dense, and deep flavors of chocolate back up the huge structure. It does work in its magnificent, flamboyant way. And at the end, the acidity does its part and gives the wine a final lift. Drink from 2024."
"As so often with Montrose, this is a powerful, concentrated and very structured wine. Dense tannins are paired with rich black fruits, although at this stage the wine also has a sense of austerity. Power, severity and complexity all make for a wine for long aging. Wait until 2019."
"Powerful, very rich and very concentrated, this epitomizes the opulent style of Cos d'Estournel. A sense of extraction is overwhelmed by the huge, ripe fruit. It shows velvet texture at first, but then the tannins come on strongly, leaving a wine that will age over many years. Drink from 2022."
"Obviously wood-aged, with a smoky toast flavor, this is a wine that shows the power of Saint-Estéphe tannins in full force. At the same time, there is a blackberry character that adds richness and juiciness, which cuts through the dry core. Age for at least 7-8 years."
"The tannins are very fine, with rich fruitcake and smoky flavors. Red berry and black plums give a fruity character, along with delicious acidity. The wine is structured while still remaining very approachable."
"This wine is dense, complex and with great tannins. It is powerful and rich, packed with black fruits. Good acidity gives the wine its freshness, its black-currant fruit and its potential longevity. Rich and with great aging potential, this is becoming a major wine in its own right rather than just a second wine of Cos d'Estournel. Drink from 2025."
"Produced by the winemaking team of Léoville las Cases, this wine comes from a separate part of the estate. The wine, with its dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon, is dense with tannins as well as dark fruit. It is firm, powerful and a very fine wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2024."
"Spicy, rich and full of ripe fruit, this wine has great potential. It is structured and dense while bringing out a stylish elegance. Blackberry fruit dominates the tannins to create a wine that has both concentration and fine fruit. Drink from 2022."
The wine is concentrated with tannins that come from both the firm fruit and the wood aging. It is packed with blackberry flavors that come through the structure strongly. The velvet texture (that is just a hint at the moment) is going to bring out the richness of this wine produced with consultation from Michel Rolland. Drink from 2024.
"Firm and tannic, this dark berry-flavored wine comes from a specific parcel in the Léoville las Cases vineyard. It's full of tannins and structure, firm and concentrated. At the end, both tannins and tight black currants promise aging. Drink from 2020."
"Despite the huge weight of fruit and accompanying structure, this is a stylish wine. It's impressively dense, concentrated and solid. At the same time, the juicy black fruits give a generous, full-in-the-mouth character. Drink this very fine wine from 2022."
"With dense fruit and a powerful, complex structure, this is one of the best wines from this chateau. Blackberries, black plums and a rich, generous character are all here, along with fine tannins. Drink this great success from 2018."
"This is a really fruity wine that's opulent and gorgeously rich. There is a pepper edge, touches of new wood and a firm, dark core. Acidity and concentration are already integrated. Drink from 2018."
"93-95. Barrel sample. Full of ripe Cabernet tannins, this is a structured wine that's chunky in character. It elegantly balances fruit and structure, resulting in a wine that's sure to be impressive."
"Ripe wine, with soft tannins allied to great density. Weight and lovely, juicy, final fruit flavors meld together easily. This is solid, dense, impressive and for long-term aging."
"This is a great success for the year, a wine that is dense, characterized by balance between sweet fruit and solid tannins. Spice from the finely judged wood aging adds extra complexity, as do the plum and berry fruits. For aging."
"This wine seems to be all about structure and tannins. The fruit comes through slowly and has a way to go in its development. But black currants are there, ripe and promising well for the future. Just don't drink before 2025."
"One of two classed-growth estates in Saint-Julien owned by the descendants of Henri Martin, this estate has been renovated and the results show in this well-crafted wine. Ripe tannins are balanced by smoky blackberry fruits and pure, clean acidity. Drink the wine from 2024."
"The tannins dominate this dark, brooding wine. At this stage, it seems to have closed up, leaving the fruit and acidity buried. But with this concentration, the future looks promising. There is a long aging potential here."
"There is a great link here between the tannins, delicious red berry fruits and blackcurrants and the almost architectural structure. The wine certainly has fine fruit, a great balance, very complete, finishing gently, ripe and soft."
"This is massive, hugely concentrated, topped with wood and intense tannins. Flavors of bitter chocolate are dominant, heavy fruits, blackberries and texture that fills the mouth with dark, dense flavors. Big in all senses."
"Impressively dense, dark flavored wine, very rich and quite extracted. But it still keeps the elegance and some of the freshness of 2004, and there is plenty of blackberry flavor to push the wine along. Heavier than many 2004s, it still shows that great acidity."
"What a perfumed, elegant, structured wine, with all the elements of fruit, wood, tannins just in the right place. It shows great tannins, powerful black and red berry fruits, denseness, and a classic, fresh aftertaste."
"Aged both in wooden tanks and wood barrels, this smooth, silky rich wine is impressive. A blend of one-third each of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, it is dense, dark and spicy. Juicy black fruits give the wine its ripe character. At the same time the structure keeps the opulent fruitiness in check. The wine is showing well now, although it will be better kept until 2018."
"The Cathiards have made a polished wine with generous fruit. It manages to combine a modern, rich style with a lightness of touch and freshness of fruit which make it instantly attractive."
"From vines on the slopes of its castle, a witness to the 1453 end of the Hundred Years' War, this solid, concentrated wine has everything in the right place. It has the power of the vintage, showing firm tannins, rich black fruits and acidity. The wine will develop slowly and surely and should be ready from 2023."
"The 16th-century fortress of La Riviére is one of the showpieces of Fronsac. In this vintage, this wine has power and dense tannins as well as concentrated black fruits. With structure and bold, ripe fruits, the wine needs to age. Drink from 2022."
"This wine comes from an estate owned by the Lesgourgues family, which also produces Armagnac. This reserve wine is richly caparisoned with tannins and powerful black-plum and berry fruits. It is rounded, rich and has a great future. Drink this dense wine from 2023."
"Owned by the Vialard family, this is a very fine wine. While it does have strong wood flavors at this young stage, they are going to be there to support the ripe jammy fruit. The wine from this 111-acre estate is generous and is going to age well. Drink from 2022."
"92-94. Barrel sample. Wood and mint aromas yield a wine that is darkly tannic, with a distinct black-coffee flavor. It's a powerful, concentrated wine with fruit hiding behind the dense structure."
"This wine comes from a 10-acre estate that is run by the same team as the much larger Château Larose Trintaudon, helping explain its quality and the richness. It has broad tannins, ripe blackberry fruit and a generous, succulent character. It should be aged further so drink from 2024."
"This is a structured wine, beautifully perfumed with richly tannic black fruits. It comes from a large 111-acre estate in the village of the same name. Made to age with firm tannins and layers of sumptuous fruit over firm wood aging, the wine will mature slowly. Drink from 2024."

"The freshness of 2004 is the hallmark of this deliciously ripe but elegant wine. It is packed with juicy red berry fruits, giving richness but vibrant acidity."

"This estate has belonged to the Edmond de Rothschild family since 1973. From one of the top performing properties in Listrac, this wine is well proportioned, rich and dense. It has weight but its main thrust is elegance, with stylish black-currant fruit, acidity and a dry core from the wood aging. The wine will age well and should not be drunk before 2023."
"Owned and produced by José Sanfins, who is the manager at neighboring classed growth Château Cantenac Brown, this wine balances the elegance of Margaux with the richness of the vintage, giving swathes of black-currant fruit that has been lifted by the new-wood aging. Drink this wine from 2023."
"The most southern of the crus bourgeois estates in Margaux, the house at Siran is familiar to visitors from its pink exterior. This vintage is powerful, but still manages to exude that Margaux style and poise. There are dense tannins but they don't overwhelm, leaving fine black fruits to balance the dryness."
"As with so many other wines from the 2001 vintage, this Palmer is classic Margaux. It has delicacy and elegance, but it also packs power, concentration and dark, dry flavors. Intense and concentrated, the richness of the high proportion of Merlot in Palmer's blend shows through, while the Cabernet Sauvignon gives a fresh lift at the end."
"Once the sole claim to fame of this estate was that it was the smallest, as well as one of the most obscure, of the classed growths. Now, its fame come from the quality of its wines. Winemaker Claire Villars-Lurton has crafted a wine that is dark and brooding, with big, powerful, intense fruit, dark flavors and solid tannins. Bordeaux in style, but has a great, polished, ripe feel too."
"The second wine from the biodynamic estate of Durfort-Vivens, this is a deliciously ripe fruity wine, dominated by 82% Cabernet Sauvignon.

"Owned by art collector Philippe Raoux, who has filled the park of the chateau with impressive sculptures, this estate produces serious and complex wines. This latest release continues in that tradition. It is rich, structured and full of swathes of black fruit. The wine will take time, so wait until 2021."
"92-94. Barrel Sample. This estate vineyard is full of modern sculptures that are collected by the owner. The wine shows fine, smooth tannins and a dark texture that gives it great long-term potential. It is a beautifully made wine: firm where it needs to be and with fine fruitiness. It will be ready in 2027."
"In the village of Soussans, and in the north of the Margaux appellation, this estate has a fine reputation for its wines. This vintage, with its great balance between fruit and tannins, shows why. It is a ripe wine full of black fruit and with the bright acidity of the vintage. Drink the wine from 2021."
"One of the largest estates in Margaux, Lascombes is now performing well. With this vintage the heavy over-oaking of past years has gone to be replaced with a wine that is full of black fruits as much as rich tannins. There is concentration and a good potential for aging. Drink from 2025."
"Dauzac, whose vineyards are in the south of Margaux, has produced a severe wine in 2010, full of impressive tannins. It is not without charm, however, and it will certainly fill out its serious structure over the next several years. Give this dense wine time."
"While it has weight and richness, this is also seriously structured, a wine packed with dry tannins. The potential is all there-the sweet fruit of the vintage along with a solid texture and final acidity."
"Firmly structured, dark-fruited wine, very solid and dense. It has weight along with black currant fruits and acidity. It's a wine that is rich but seriously structured for aging."

"Big, rich, almost velvet in texture, this is a powerful wine. It has spice, black berry fruits, layers of wood and black plum skins. Powerful wine for long-term aging and medium-term accessibility."
"Firm, solid, chunky, a great success from a Château that is currently in top form, even in more difficult years. The bright fruits charge through the tannins, giving some richness, balancing with the elegance and freshness of the year. Worth aging."
"Silky wine, fresh and light, balanced with high acidity cutting through black berry fruits. The structure has some substance, but this is a light, aromatic wine, developing fast, already delicious, and only for medium-term aging."
"Owner Philippe Raoux has created both a major sculpture park and a series of impressive vintages at this estate at the western end of Margaux. This vintage is one of the best yet, rich and vibrant with great fruits and solid tannins. It needs serious aging, so drink from 2025."
"This dense and impressively ripe wine comes from a Sorge family estate in the northern part of the Margaux appellation. With black fruits and generous tannins, it is a big wine with considerable richness. This complex wine will age. Drink from 2025."
"This 11-acre property, centered on an ultramodern winery, is the most northerly estate in Margaux. The wine, with its blend of dense tannins and juicy black-currant fruit, is rich, with impressive concentration and minerality. With weight and a firm core, the wine will age well. Drink from 2025."

"A powerfully ripe wine, with pure black currant flavors over soft, polished tannins. The wood balance is exemplary, offering just the right lift. Touches of cinnamon and vanilla give an extra dimension."
"Managed by Jean-Hubert Delon of Léoville Las Cases, this is without equal in the Medoc appellation. It shows breeding, depth of flavor, beautifully crafted tannins and fine, rich fruit without the overripeness so characteristic of 2003. With its structure, acidity and delicious fruit, this will age as well as any wine from a more classy appellation."
"The fifth vintage from this estate since its purchase by the Barton family of Léoville Barton in Saint-Julien, this is a generous, structured wine. It has ripe black fruits in profusion that are held together by the serious layer of tannins. Rich and concentrated, the wine will age for many years. Drink from 2024."
"Powerfully structured, with great depth and huge, ripe fruit, along with a muscular freshness of both fruit and tannins. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This Peyronie family cru bourgeois estate is one of the rare properties in Pauillac that is not a classified growth. That alone makes it a good value. The wine comes from vines close to Pichon Baron in the south of the appellation. This juicy black-currant flavored wine is still very young, full of its tannins and dark character. With its structure and acidity, the wine will age well. Drink from 2022."
"Unusual for a Bordeaux, this is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. It has plenty of tannins, although they are embedded in the pure black-currant fruits and the acidity. It shows the gentle side of Comtesse-fruit and freshness-although with spice and a touch of wood that are likely to balance soon. The wine will develop well over the next few years. Drink from 2022."
"This is a structured wine, firm with tannins and still showing some of the wood-aging. Red-berry fruits are cut with crisper blueberries and considerable acidity. This is going to be a firm wine that is lightened by the fruit, and a very good representative of the vintage. Drink from 2020."
"Lafite's second wine is much closer to a balance of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that the first wine. It's also a properly rich, satisfying wine that is as much fruit as structure. Packed with blackberry fruits, it has a fresh character that dominates the firmer tannins and touch of bitter chocolate. Drink from 2020."
"This wine is characterized by both structure and rich fruitiness. A dark, smoky character brings out the solid tannins that underlie the black currant fruitiness and the balance. Although it doesn't have power, an intensity gives a flavor that lasts in the mouth. Drink this wine from 2018."
"One of the chateaus owned by négociant Borie-Manoux, Lynch-Moussas has produced a fine, stylish 2010, which is firmly based on Cabernet Sauvignon. The fruit is rich and ripe, dominated by a blackberry note and underpinned by tannins. This is a chateau to watch."
"Smooth black currant fruit with great density as well as superripeness. The wine is charming, while still having a powerful structure. Still a relative value in Pauillac, Batailley is now showing real class."
"A complex, dusty tannin wine, layering smoky wood and black fruits with a the firmest dry character. Very intense, rich, dense and potentially powerful."
"Deliciously fruity, with chocolate notes and acidity. The wine has dense but soft tannins that merge seamlessly into the black fruits. It is ripe, sweet, densely juicy."
"Rich, impressively ripe fruit, the fruit dense and black, with juicy black plum flavors followed by dusty tannins. The wine is chunky, powerful for the year, the dryness smoothed by new wood."
"A dark charactered wine, with solid tannins and firm, extracted fruit flavors. The berry fruits are juicy and sweet, with the dusty tannins coming from the Cabernet in the blend. The finish is softer, more black jelly in texture."
"This wine comes from a 50-acre crus bourgeois estate in the middle of some of the greatest crus classés estates. The terroir is impressive and produces a rich, structured wine with good concentration, ripe tannins and a sumptuous bed of black fruits. The wine is likely to age well; drink from 2025."
"This is the Pauillac-appellation portion of a larger vineyard, Château Peyrabon, which is in the Haut-Médoc. The wine is rich, perfumed and likely to age very well. Juicy acidity and firm texture go with the black-currant fruit in a wine that will become balanced and elegant. Drink from 2024."

"Ripe and spicy, this wine comes from an estate on the western edge of Pauillac. Young fruit, toast and fine tannins are combining well into a rich wine that is likely to develop relatively quickly, very much in the style of this property. Drink from 2024."
"Under the attention of the Miecaze family, this ancient estate has burst out of a dormant period and into new life with vineyards, a winery, a restaurant and a B&B.

It has fine potential and will be ready from 2020."

"The estate is within the urban area of Bordeaux, an oasis of green in the busy city. It is a smooth, rich wine that has benefited from the consultancy work of the late Denis Dubourdieu. Ripe tannins and fine acidity support the black currant and plum fruits. The wine is developing well. Drink from 2020."
"Dense, concentrated and firm, this wine has a powerful, rich structure that promises well. Big berry fruits and dark tannins are developing well together. The wine is full of promise so drink from 2020. Fifteen-percent of the 74 acres of vines are more than 120 years old. New York banker Robert G. Wilmers bought Haut-Bailly in 1998 from the Sanders family, owners since 1955. Véronique Sanders-van Beek has run the estate since then."
"Powerful and dense, this wine has great potential. With full-bodied blackberry fruits and acidity that push through the dark tannins, it shows a rich character that is impressive for the year. Drink from 2020. The property has been owned since 1999 by Sophie Lurton of neighboring Château Bouscaut."
"This has smooth, rich fruit, with sweet berries, ripe tannins and strong layers of wood. The wine is powerful; the stalky and bitter chocolate edge contrasts the sweet, ripe fruit. This is meant for long-term aging."
"A powerful, ripe wine, solid tannins and rich black plum and currant fruits. The wine is very much in the Malartic-Lagraviére style of rich, dense fruits layered with tannins."
"A smooth, velvet textured wine, piled high with sweet, ripe flavors. There is fine, opulent concentration here, impressive density, and a solid, tannic core. While it is not as powerful as some vintages from this estate, it certainly suggests the ability to age 5-6 years and more."
"Although it has a long history, this estate was neglected for many years. Now it is getting back on form, and this wine shows the potential. It is a full while elegant wine, firm with its tannins and open with its ripe black fruits. It offers a lifted character, both from the acidity and from the clean aftertaste. Drink from 2024."
"This is dense and concentrated, reflecting the character of Haut-Brion itself. It has weight, firm tannins and power alongside juicy black fruits and acidity that will give great pleasure as they develop. Drink from 2023."
"The second wine of Pape Clément, named after the papal crossed keys, this bottling well reflects the top wine. It has the same ripe, dusty tannins and juicy acidity, rich while structured, and likely will age well over the medium term. It will be a delicious, rich wine as it matures. Drink from 2021."
"Produced by the winemaking team of Château la Dominique in Saint-Émilion, this bijou production wine is richly endowed both with tannins and black fruits. It has a perfumed touch as well as full, generous berry flavors and succulent acidity. Drink from 2022."
"The wine, with its firm tannins and solid structure, is still young. The hints of black-plum fruits are way behind the structure. That's all good, because this wine will come together well, to give a rich full wine with spice, juicy black fruits and acidity. Drink from 2020."
"The tannins and density of this wine are impressive. With its strong structure and concentrated fruit, the wine is ripe and likely to age well. Blackberry and red-cherry flavors dominate a wine that is going to be ready to drink from 2022."
"Ripe and structured, this has black plum and ripe berry flavors that are lifted by the acidity typical of the vintage. Tannins are solid and dense, packed around the fruit, and show that the wine is still young. Drink this solid while fruity wine from 2020."
"Powerful tannins give this wine its dense, concentrated character. It is dark and dense, very dry at this stage and needing at least 10 years to round itself out. However, the presence of fruit promises a good future."
"Big tannins give this wine a powerful structure. It has a dense texture that is slowly revealing the sweet-tasting fruit. Powerful and concentrated, it has a long future."
"Densely rich, very sweet wine. It has some smoky tannins that give structure, along with a dark core of dry raisin and wood flavors. It has concentration and an opaque texture."
"This is a rich, powerful wine, packed with generous and opulent Merlot fruit and with a structure that is firm and concentrated. A fruity wine, it's rich, dense and needs to age. It comes from a small seven-acre vineyard located in the heart of Pomerol. Drink from 2023."
"For a Pomerol, which would normally be almost entirely Merlot, this has a good amount of Cabernet Franc in the blend. The firm tannins and perfumed character of the Cabernet contrast with and balance the rich, jammy Merlot. It's still very young, so don't drink before 2023."
"With its 30% Cabernet Franc, this perfumed wine is full of structured fruit as well as succulent blackberry flavors. It's rich and already delicious. However, this stylish wine needs aging to show at its best. Drink from 2022."
"Rich blackberry fruit and layers of tannins are a great combination for this wine that has profited from the quality of the Cabernet Franc in this vintage. It has plenty of fruit and acidity, as well as firm, still-toasty tannins. The wine needs to age. Drink from 2023."
"This estate, just to the east of the city of Saint-Émilion, has produced a spicy wine with layers of dark chocolate and wood flavors. The wine has weight and a rich texture that still allows room for the ripe black-currant fruits. Drink from 2025."
"Under the regime of Gérard Perse, Pavie seems to have become more opulent, more extracted, and, dare I say it, more simplistic. The richness of the 2000 vintage lends itself to this technique. While it is a wonderful, immediately appealing wine, with its intense dark fruits, it seem to lack the complexity of other wines of similar status."
"This is the flagship wine from the mini-empire (now comprising five properties) that is controlled by Comte Stephan von Niepperg. He has made a modern, wood dominated wine, with rich, concentrated black fruits. It is powerful, perhaps too powerful, lacking a sense of the usual grace of this estate, although the ripeness of the wine does compensate."
"This Moueix-owned premier grand cru classé property quietly goes about producing great wines. The 2000 is a complete success, with its aromas of red berry fruits and sweet wood, its flavors cedar and truffles alongside the fine, elegant tannins. It will age slowly and reveal layers of complexity over the years."
"The second wine of this Premier Grand Cru Classé estate is very fine. With its rich tannins, generous acidity and black fruits, it is solid and dense while having such attractive fruitiness. The wine will age well, full of ripe fruit and with excellent concentration. Drink from 2021."
"Rounded and rich, this single-vineyard wine is concentrated without losing a touch of its beautiful fruit. It has a fine balance between fruit and acidity as well as a tense line of minerality and tight texture. Drink this impressive wine from 2024."
"Produced from biodynamically grown grapes, this is a fine, smooth and rich wine. Great tannins are cushioned within the ripe blackberry fruits and generous texture. It is already a delicious wine, although certain to age as well. The estate is close to Château Figeac. Drink from 2022."
"From the vineyard on the slope above Château Pavie, this is a beautiful, juicy and ripe wine. It has a mineral character with great swathes of black-currant fruit. This is a very fine wine, well delineated, ripe and with a delicious red-currant aftertaste. Drink from 2026."
"This is a deliciously balanced wine. Spice from the wood aging makes a happy contrast with the black-currant fruit and acidity. It is elegant and with great fruitiness. The wine, with its tannic base, will age well. The estate is to the west of Saint-Emilion, close to Château Figeac. Drink from 2023."
"The second wine of this Saint-Emilion Premier Grand Cru Classé estate comes from selected parcels. Rich and with the smoothness of oak aging and ripe grapes, it is a generous wine that is developing well. Drink from 2020."
"Tight, textured and mineral, this wine just hints at the fruit to come. It is dark, brooding and concentrated, with black-plum flavors just beginning to shine through the dry texture. It needs aging, so drink from 2022."
"The second wine of Château Ausone is impressive in its own right. It reflects the fruitier, Merlot side of the vineyard, with ripe black fruits coming through the tannins. The wood aging does show in a vanilla character that will disappear as it matures. It's ripe, full of juicy fruit and ready to age over the medium term. Drink from 2019."
"Very structured and packed with tannins, this has the weight to balance those qualities, promising layers of black fruits as it develops. There's a mineral character here, the tannins in suspension. The aftertaste brings out delicious, lightly salty acidity. Drink from 2018."
"A hugely concentrated wine, it has a dark feel to it, mineral and structured. It shows spice, suggestions of the wood aging and always the ripest fruit. Drink from 2018."
"There is a sense of alcohol with this wine. It is so rich, so dense, so ripe. The texture is round, full in the mouth with a touch of pepper. As a contrast, it also shows a surprising amount of freshness, especially in the aftertaste. Drink this ultra-rich wine from 2018."
"This is a hugely rich wine with great black-plum fruit flavors. It's powerfully concentrated, densely tannic, solid and chunky."
"92-94. Barrel sample. The only Grand Cru Classé on the sandy plain of Saint-Emilion, Monbousquet is producing great wines thanks to huge investments by owner Gerard Perse. This Merlot-dominated blend is ripe, spicy, rich and open."
"An impressive wine. It is very structured, dominated at this stage by young tannins. It will always be a firm wine, while the excellent dark plum fruit will give it weight and richness. Age this powerful wine for at least six years."
"Deliciously perfumed wine, full of the ripest fruit along with smoky tannins. It revels in the bright fruit flavors that add to the pleasure. This is a wine that will develop relatively quickly, although it will age as well."
"A charmer of a wine, all fruit and sweet tannins. It is dense, the flavors going right down into the core of the wine and bringing back beautiful red perfumed fruits. La Dominique, next door to Cheval Blanc, is now performing well."
"Very intense wine, packed with dark tannins, solid and powerful. It is leavened with great perfumes, while the overall effect is dark, brooding and concentrated."
"With its classic mineral edge, dusty tannins and firm, dry structure, the wine has a core that weighs well with the severe texture. As a contrast, the fruit underneath is ripe and juicy. A wine for several years' aging."
"A solidly structured wine, filled with fig, bitter coffee, spice and wood over a firm structure of tannins. The freshness is quite intense, but the ripe fruit is vivid with layered acidity and new wood. This is a serious wine, for aging."
"With plenty of new wood, the wine has a velvet character, smooth and round. Only gradually does a plum skin, bitter chocolate element come in, giving structure and weight. This is a wine that should age well."
"This wine is richly endowed with dense tannins, powerful black-plum fruit and a solid texture. Flavors of dark chocolate and wood-aging spice add to the complexity. Drink from 2023."
"This wine is beautifully dense and rich. With generous tannins and succulent black fruits, it is both concentrated and bright. An edge of bitter coffee will soften to allow the wine to broaden out. The wine will be ready to drink from 2024."
"This estate is the pride of the Aubert family, which owns 600 acres on the right bank of Bordeaux. It is juicy with blackberry fruit, rich with tannins and dense with a firm structure. The wine is set for a long aging, so don't touch it before 2023."
"A recent acquisition of the Janoueix family, this estate is getting into its stride. This wine has plenty of the rich black fruit of the vintage along with a firm structure that will allow it to age. Flavors from the new wood used for aging show in the spice and the dry core of the wine. Drink this ripe wine from 2024."
"This wine is light and fruity, with attractive acidity and a crisp texture. Black-currant flavors and balanced tannins keep it elegant and delicious. It is crisp, fresh and likely to develop over the medium term. Drink from 2023."
"The second wine of Château Valandraud, this is rich, spicy with great fruit and firm tannins. The wood aging is still showing but it will soon integrate better with the ripeness of the rich fruit. This wine has weight, plenty of black fruit and acidity. Drink from 2022."
This ripe wine is full of dusty tannins and has a dense structure. These give power to the wine with its concentration and richness. Bright acidity cuts through to give a crisp edge to the ripeness. Drink this dense wine from 2022.
"This smooth, rich and fine wine is maturing well. It has a good balance of ripe fruit and acidity. Bitter coffee and spice notes add complexity while not detracting from the fruit. Drink from 2020."
"This is the first vintage of this new purchase by Sylvie Cazes, a leading figure in the Bordeaux wine scene. A classed growth, it's richly fruity yet structured and firm, with dense tannins and layers of delicious black fruit. With its tannins still well at the fore, it will need to age further, so drink from 2022."
"Benefiting from the great quality of Cabernet Franc in 2006, this is a beautiful wine, perfumed and seductive. The fruit tannins are so well integrated with wood that they are only just dominant. Ripe, opulent but also firmly structured, this will age magnificently over five years or more."
"Le Carré is a 3.5-acre vineyard close to the town of Saint-Emilion, producing a highly perfumed wine showing exciting Cabernet Franc character. The texture is dark and dense, although the sweetness of the fruit is very evident. Fleshy and ripe."
"Under the ownership of the Gardinier family, this chateau now rivals some of the classed growths, and deserves its crus bourgeois exceptionnel classification. It is certainly full of new wood flavors, but these are not allowed to dominate dense fruit tannins, flavors of black plums and fine layers of acidity. Will certainly age for 10+ years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"One of the stars in the world of the crus bourgeois, categorized as cru bourgeois exceptionnel in 2003, this wine is qualitatively at the level of many classed growths. Its rich fruit is punctuated with toasty new wood flavors, which should soften and balance in the next few years. An impressive wine that shows great power."
"One of the nine crus bourgeois exceptionnel, this estate is under the ownership of the Cazes family of Château Lynch-Bages. With the same winemaking team, it's no wonder that Ormes de Pez is up with classed growths in quality. The character of 2003 gives this wine black tarry flavors, but it hasn't spoiled the wine's dry tannins, structure or its long-term potential. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This is a solid, huge wine, with rich but very dry tannins. With its dense, almost black color, and its sense of brooding power, it promises long aging. It will never be in the opulent Bordeaux camp, despite its prominent new wood flavors, but will probably outlive all but a handful top wines."
"Under the ownership of Jacky Lorenzetti, president of one of France's top rugby clubs, this estate is now performing impressively. The wine is finely structured with dark tannins and tight acidity and a hint of minerality. It is Merlot dominated, although it is the 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that brings out the black-currant fruitiness. Drink from 2022."
"This estate, dating to the 18th century and close to the Gironde estuary, has produced a rich wine. Young tannins and fine fruity acidity are both present in a wine that is serious and dense. Its weight, ripeness and the potential of the black-currant fruit will all allow it to age. Drink from 2022."
"Packed with the dark tannins and structure of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine, produced by the team of Calon Ségur is intense, concentrated and dark. It has a firm structure, solid and with a luscious aftertaste. The acidity of the year just shows at the end. Drink from 2026."
"This second wine of Calon Ségur is beautifully proportioned. It is fruity with rich tannins. At the same time, the crisp fruit of the vintage gives a lift to the deep concentration. Let the wine develop over several years. Drink from 2024."
The second wine of Cos d'Estournel is powerfully packed with tannins and dark ripe fruit. It is enormously rich and intense while keeping a fine smooth texture. There is a dark core that is going to allow the wine to develop over many years. Drink from 2024.
"The wine is powerful with fine tannins and concentrated black fruits. The dense texture is lifted by the acidity and beautiful fruit of the vintage. The tannins are dusty, tight and surrounded by beautiful fruit and acidity. This, the second wine of Montrose, will develop surely over the next several years. Drink from 2024."
"Owned by the Cuvelier family of Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien and with Michel Rolland as consultant, this is a fine estate with an equally fine chateau. It is dense and richly endowed with black fruits and spice. At the same time, it has style and a way with its fruit and acidity that give it a lift. Drink this very ageworthy wine from 2023."
"Big-hearted fruit dominates this smooth wine. The estate, owned by the Tesseron family and close to their other property of Pontet-Canet, is performing well and it shows in this juicy ripe wine, full of generous tannins. The aftertaste shows both acidity and concentration. Drink from 2022."
"Owned by the Cuveliers who also own Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien, Le Crock in 2012 is a powerhouse of ripe tannins and juicy acidity. It's a wine that demands aging with its tannins and still-youthful fruitiness. Drink from 2019."
"While the wood is still very apparent in this wine, it does also have the rich fruit as a balance. The acidity, dark berry fruits and a fine juicy character go with the firm tannins and spicy wood character. Drink from 2017."
"With layers of wood, this is a structured wine, driven as much by tannins as fruit. It will need time for the dark plum fruit flavors to come through-St.-Estéphe is always likely to be firmly textured."
This small eight-acre estate is owned by negociant Cheval Quancard. The year has produced a success story for a wine that has a great balance as well as potential richness. Broad black fruit adds to the dense tannins of the appellation to create a bold wine that's likely to age well. Drink from 2023.
"The rich wood and fruit of this wine already show good balance. The estate, owned by Bordeaux negociant Dourthe, is now on excellent form with this structured wine offering concentration and long-term aging. The tannins and the dry core from roughly equal proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot and a pinch of Petit Verdot promise great potential. Drink from 2025."
"With Michel Rolland as consultant and the Cuvelier family, also owners of Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien, in charge, no wonder this is an impressive wine. It has put on weight since it was tasted at en primeur. Packed with tannins, dark fruits and potential, it is a wine for aging. Solid tannins march along with the black fruit, acidity and spice from wood aging. The wine will take its time and will not be ready before 2025."
"Taking its name from the hill or Cos on which the vines are planted, this wine is dense and full of firm tannins. The fruit is there as well, ripe black currants waiting to come through the tannins. Give this wine time and drink from 2026."
"This property, owned by the Cazes family of Lynch-Bages in Pauillac, has produced a structured wine. Its tannins show most strongly at the moment. Sustained by black-currant fruit, they will keep the wine firm although with a rich, generous style in the future. Drink from 2025."
This impressive wine is full of black fruits as well as dark tannins. Its structure and density comes from the vineyard that abuts grand cru estates in Saint-Julien. The wine has power while as well as the elegance of the appellation. Drink from 2023.
"The most beautifully situated chateau, with its great view of the Gironde estuary, Beychevelle is another of those Médoc estates that has found top form after a fallow period in the 1980s and early '90s. The wine's generosity,  sweetness and fruit is balanced with the carefully crafted structure of wood that underpins it all. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"A huge, opulent wine that packs sweet, rich tannins and spicy fruit. In the midst of all this decadence, though, is a kernel of tannic dryness. This estate, long the weakest of the three Léoville wines, is now back in top form. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"From one of the few estates in Saint-Julien that is not a classified growth, this wine represents a bargain. The wine is rich, perfumed and beautifully structured. It has a velvety consistency with its ripe black currants and generous tannins. The estate is named after the mill belonging to Abbot Bridane in the Middle Ages. Drink from 2022."
"Firmly tannic and concentrated, this wine demonstrates how this property has developed impressively in recent years. It is certainly powerful, although managing to retain the Saint-Julien elegance. The blackberry fruits will develop well as it matures. Drink from 2024."

"This rare unclassified growth from Saint-Julien has all of the elegance you would expect, and it balances firm tannins with a classic black-currant flavor. It has dark, structured tannins, with layers of wood and acidity on the fragrant finish. Keep this for many years."
"From one of the few Saint-Julien properties that are not cru classé, this nevertheless shows all the class of the appellation. It has ripe black-currant and berry flavors, laced with acidity and dry, dense tannins. Its richness  is still developing. This has considerable aging potential."
"Darkly colored wine, with flavors as rich as the color. It has opulent new wood and black plum fruit flavors, the acidity offering a succulent aspect as well as dense tannins and ripe power. It does need aging, but could well develop quickly."
"A deceptively approachable wine. Its gorgeous fruits are right up front, their ripeness powered by a generous, complex texture. There is concentration, but it is surrounded by so much richness. It can almost be drunk now, but should age well."
"Initially generous, the wine then becomes much more solid and dense. The structure is all there along with the ripest fruit. It is delicious and darkly tannic at the same time."
"An opulent, ripe wine from the ever-improving Beychevelle. It is rounded with new wood flavors along with just the right amount of tannin. Deceptively soft, with a solid, dry character behind the fruit."
"Initially wood dominates, but this is a stage after bottling. Because then the ripe, smooth fruit comes in, pouring through with black fruits, very ripe and juicy. As this wine develops, this rich fruit will be its main character."
"A very powered wine, pushing forward with solid, but always fresh structure and fruit. The wine bursts with ripe jammy fruits, but is also firmly tannic. It combines sweet weight with final extreme, exuberant freshness."
"A powerful, extracted wine, very concentrated. The tannins are dense, giving a sense of tight texture, while underneath the ripe fruits are pulsing with fresh acidity as well as sweet berry flavors."
"From one of the rare estates in Saint-Julien that is not a classed growth, this wine has many of the same perfumed, elegant characteristics as its illustrious neighbors. Restrained tannins show well against the ripe black-currant fruit and spice from new-wood aging. Drink this wine from 2024."
"A harmonious balanced wine, showing fine, fresh acidity. The tannins have closed in somewhat, but you can taste the chocolate, and the sweet character of the ripe fruit. At the end, the acidity gives a fine lift."
"This is the luxury Cuvée from vineyards in the Seze family since 1918. With its perfumed fruits and firm tannins it is serious as well as sumptuous. It has weight and a dry texture that will soften into the blackberry fruits and generous structure. This wine, with its still-firm texture, needs to age, so drink from 2022."
"This is a micro-sized nine-acre estate, with vines that are 50 years old. Complex and rich, it is a generous burst of ripe full Merlot that is developing well. Black fruits, spice and juicy acidity all contribute to a wine that will ready to drink from 2017."
"Though he'd rather be a musical genius, Jean-François Reaud did wonders with this estate, in the family since 1904. Dense and full of tannins, it also offers ripe fruits. Its structure and density match the intensity of the fruit, meaning the wine has a great future. With a dense aftertaste, the wine will age, so drink from 2022."
"This Bayle-Carreau wine, one of five fifth-generation family estates, is balanced between the dry core of tannins and the ripe black fruit. With acidity and a fine structure, it has great potential. As it develops the wine will show richness as well as concentration. Drink from 2018."
"This special selection, tight-cropped from 30 acres of 100% Merlot, is ripe and rich. This is a smoky and fruity wine, in barrel for 14 months. It has ripe black fruits and rich, dense structure. Spice and toast balance the fruit, giving an impressive sense of generosity. Drink from 2017."
"For the vintage, this is an austere style of wine, emphasising tannins over fruit. The fruit is certainly rich, and the tannins are dusty rather than dry, but it is a wine which is developing more slowly, suggesting it is also a wine for long-term aging."
"This Moreaud family estate lies in the Figeac sector on the western side of the Saint-Émilion appellation. With the richness of dense Merlot lifted by perfumed Cabernet Franc, the wine is ripe, full of blueberry and black-cherry fruit and has a fine edge of acidity. Drink the wine from 2021."
"A very polished performance from one of the best wine producers in Bordeaux's Entre-deux-Mers region. The color is brightly purple. Sweet fruit aromas go through to the modern, smooth flavors, balancing new wood and ripe black fruit. While the wood tannins dominate at the moment, they should soften, and this will become a fine, ageworthy wine."
"The appellation may be Bordeaux Supérieur but the quality of this wine, owned by a member of the Lurton family, is way beyond that. A rich wine from 30-year-old vines, it's packed with dense blackberry fruit and ripe tannins. The structure and the concentration of this wine indicate it needs to age. Drink from 2022."

"This property belonged to the Le Rey family since the 1600s. The last descendant sold in 2016, making this the first vintage of new owners Peter Kwok, Philippe Lambrecht and Jean-Christophe Meyrou. This wine is already balanced, full of rich black-currant fruits and generous, structured tannins. The dry core of the wine will take time to soften, so wait until 2022."
"This ripe, juicy wine offers balanced smoky wood-aging flavors.

Drink this wine that has the power and the fruit intensity of the vintage from 2021."

"This wine is finely balanced-an impressive mix of ripe fruit and rich tannins. A smoky character envelops its rich blackberry and plum flavors, all underlined with tannins. It needs to age and will be best from 2020."

"Swathes of dark tannins and a dense texture introduce a wine that needs to age. The black fruits, rich structure and concentration are part of this firm wine made under the direction of cellarmaster Géraldine Lussiez. With layers of rich wood from 12 months in 400-liter barrels and black-currant flavors, it is still developing. Drink from 2022."
"Dusty tannins and ripe fruit set the scene for this wine, which is rich in both structure and black fruit. With its concentration, it is sure to develop well, likely to mature easily over several years. Drink from 2020."
"A rich, velvet textured wine, full of dense, dusty tannins and sweet black Merlot fruits. The wine is concentrated, ripe and powerful, with a dark texture that is both impressive and ageworthy. Give this wine at least 5-6 years."
"A rustic wine, with definite barnyard flavors. The fruit has some smoky extract, but the tannins and old wood tastes intrude too much."
"One of the top Graves estates has produced this fine, ripe 2012. It is still young, showing its toasty, smoky wood flavors, but has plenty of tannic structure that's firm for aging. The fruit and acidity are all there, promising a balanced wine from 2018. Hubert de Boüard (Château Angelus) is consulting enologist for the Lévéque family owners."
"The minty aromas indicate new wood aging as well as a ripe, polished texture. They make for a wine that has presence and structure as well as rich fruitiness, blackberry flavors and a dry, solid core. It's a sophisticated wine that can age. Drink from 2017."
This richly structured wine is full of solid tannins and generous black-fruit flavors. Ripe berries and juicy acidity give a balanced counterpoint to the tannins. Wait until 2023 for this wine to fully integrate.

"A good dash of Petit Verdot in the blend has given this fine wine its extra structure. It is still firm and tight at this young stage although the black-currant fruitiness promises much. From vines west of Pauillac, it is impressively solid and dense. Drink from 2022."
"Obviously the producer thinks this is an important wine judging by the unusually heavy bottle. The wine is certainly attractively rich and full bodied. With weighty blackberry fruit and a concentrated core of tannins, it is balanced, fruity and likely to age well. There is a mineral edge that will soften as the wine matures. Drink from 2021."
"The vineyard is in the heart of the Haut-Médoc, midway between Margaux and Saint-Julien. The wine is solid, dark and with plenty of firm tannins. At the same time, it has concentrated black fruits and a fine blend between black-currant acidity and ripe jammy fruitiness. Drink from 2020."

"Owned by Château Larose-Trintaudon, this wine's vines are close to Margaux. In its much-too-heavy bottle, it's full of ripe and juicy black fruits, opulent and rich. The 100% new-wood aging has not spoiled the fruit, rather given it lift and smoothness. It's destined to age well, so drink from 2018."

"While it is closed and tough at present, this is definitely a wine with a future. The hand-harvested 65% Merlot and 35% Cabernet Franc blend has both firm tannins and the promise of ripe fruits, black berries and a rich, opulent character. Spice and new wood (one-third new French oak) are balanced by the fruits and they are brought together by the acidity at the end. Sophie Lavaud, who has owned the 13-acre estate since 2010, is in the process of getting organic certification."
"This 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot wine is ripe and spicy. Solid fruit gives a juicy character along with a strong sense of structure.

Along with owner Monique Bonnet's Château Suau, this vineyard was certified French organic with the 2012 vintage. Drink from 2018."

"From vines owned by the Aubert family in Castillon, this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Merlot is ripe and full of black-currant fruits. Firm tannins allied to the toastiness from wood aging leave a mix of spice, a dry core and rich flavors. Drink from 2022."
"Layers of ripe fruits, rich and packed with red-berry flavors, give this wine concentration and an already delicious fruitiness. It is produced by Thierry Valette, whose family is prominent in Saint-Emilion. The fruit needs perhaps to calm down and fully integrate, so wait until 2021."

"Very young, this wine is just setting out. It has firm tannins, dark-chocolate flavors that give some bitterness and layers of wood and dark-black fruits from organic grapes. It is going to take time for this ripe concentrated wine to develop. The acidity and black-plum-skin texture at the end show it will age. Drink from 2020."
"A fruity, juicy wine with balanced tannins and red fruits. It is a lively perfumed wine that has some toasty tannins in the background. Drink this ripe wine from 2019. One of five wineries owned by Bernadette Faure and Alain Aubert; their daughters oversee vineyards, winemaking and marketing."
"Anne-Marie and Jean-Guy Todeschini started a revolution here and at Château Mangot and sons Karl and Yann (mid-Millennials) are moving it on.

Oenologist Jean-Marc Domme runs the estate with consultant Thomas Duclos."

"With the same winemaking team as Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande in Pauillac, Bernadotte has a good pedigree.

"Considerable depth of flavor here, with complex ripe tannins, topping the dense black fruits. There's spice from the wood, some stalky tannins from the fruit, and an edge of youth that will need 3-4 years to show its potential."

Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd."

Imported by Victoire Imports."
"Finally it looks as if Lascombes is back on form. With its huge vineyard, a good selection of the best fruit has been the issue, and this has happened with 2003. It's not a huge wine, but there is smooth, polished fruit, layered with wood and  dusty tannins. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."

"Thanks to the total dedication of owner Jean-Luc Vonderheyden, Monbrison continued to perform outside its class in 2000.

It is soft, which suggests its aging will be fast, but the liquorice fruit flavors and ripeness will give pleasure after five years."
"If Margaux is the most delicate of the Médoc wines, then this is the epitome of Margaux. It is light, poised and attractively perfumed. The fruit is elegant and fresh with a fine streak of acidity."

"Big, rounded wine that brings together ripe fruits and taut tannins. It is solid, chunky, spiced and balanced. Black fruits finish an impressive wine for the vintage."
"Produced from a small acre of land in Margaux, this is made in the same extravagant style as the cult wines of Saint-Emilion. With 100% new wood, it is definitely modern in style, but there is sufficient concentration in the fruit to balance all that vanilla. It misses the 2006 freshness,but everything else is there."
