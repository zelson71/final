An Alliance Bourg member."
"Ripe and smoky, this offers great fruit that bursts through the tannic structure.

Producer Arnaud Pomme works with co-operative Alliance Bourg."

"Ripe and fruity, this red-berry flavored wine has good acidity and a crisp, bright texture. The tannins are now well integrated into the fruit, giving a structured, yet fresh, aftertaste. Drink now.

This wine has fresh acidity and attractive black currant fruit flavors. They are given a hard ride by the dark and bitter tannins and dry texture. This is a Carreau family wine.
"This wine is concentrated, with fruit that seems too ripe. Jammy berry flavors are mixed in with dry tannins and a firm backdrop. It's solid, although not quite balanced. The estate was founded in 1967 by Philippe Raguenot; daughters Emmanuelle and Marie-Pierre took over in 1997."
"Heavy wood aromas from new French oak barrels show equally strongly as dark chocolate flavors on the palate from this 50/50 Merlot/Malbec blend. The wine, tiny production from 2.5 acres, is all wood, very firm and tough. Only the acidity suggests a potential fruitiness. This estate has been in the Noël family since 1800."
Jammy fruits conflict with a firm tannic structure. This wine is not yet balanced and needs a lighter touch. Producer is Jean Paul Barre.

"From selected parcels on the Bertinerie vineyard, this is still a young, firmly structured wine. Red berry fruits offer a contrast to the solid tannins and rich texture. The wood aging still shows, giving a spicy character that will integrate as the wine matures. Drink from 2017."
"The wood-aging flavors are strong although not too dominant. They ride well with the solid fruit tannins, flavorsome blackberry fruits and firm, smoky aftertaste. This balanced wine will need some aging; drink from 2016."
"Hand-sorting and 18 months of aging is the key here. This 80% Merlot blend with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc offers a generously proportioned balance of tannins and black fruits.

Drink from 2018."
"This special selection, tight-cropped from 30 acres of 100% Merlot, is ripe and rich. This is a smoky and fruity wine, in barrel for 14 months. It has ripe black fruits and rich, dense structure. Spice and toast balance the fruit, giving an impressive sense of generosity. Drink from 2017."
"Here's a solid wine full of both tannins and dark fruits. New oak barrels give a spicy character while supporting the fruitiness. A blend of 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon from only 10 acres, it is developing into a rich wine that still needs time. Drink this impressive wine from 2018."
"Made from old vines, this complex and structured wine brings out the richness and ripe tannins of 2010. It's firm although the fruit concentration is what shows most strongly. It's an impressive, juicy, red-fruited wine that will age. Drink from 2017."
"The ninth generation of the Dublois family goes for tight cropping on only 7.5 acres for Nectar (95% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon). Layers of wood dominate this wine.

Firm and dry now, it will be worth the wait. Drink from 2018."

"Situated on limestone and clay (peyredoulle means hard rock in an old dialect), the wine offers spice and sweet fruit flavors, balancing wood and fruitiness. The classic Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot blend has considerable potential, allowing plenty of room for the fruit and the wood tannin flavors to integrate. Drink from 2017."
"Alain and Céline Vidal's second brand (they also own Château Dubraud) is a fruity blend of Merlot (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%) and Cabernet Franc (15%) although the smoky wood flavors also have an important place.

"This Cuvée honors a sailor who, in 1919, docked his boat, La Favorite, at Blaye in the Gironde estuary and bought the property. It is still owned by the l'Amouller family. Juicy and fruity, this wine is immediately attractive and accessible. Red fruits, soft tannins and a bite of acidity all contribute to the ready-to-drink taste."
"This spicy 100% Merlot wine has tangy black fruits as well as dense texture. It is ripe and very juicy, with intense acidity. It needs to relax (25% new oak barrels; 25% one to two years, the rest in tanks), so drink from 2017."
This is ripe and juicy with friendly acidity and tannins from 10 months' wood aging in two- to five-year-old barrels. Black fruits are coupled with minerality to give a wine that is both structured and with plenty of generous fruitiness. The property is run by the seventh generation of the Carreau family.
"Night harvesting on the highest hill in Blaye is tricky but the Chety family pulls it off. Ripe and juicy, this is a ready-to-drink wine.

"The wine has a hard extracted edge, with bitter tannins that are dominating the fruitiness. It needs to soften and bring out the berry fruits, although the wine will always have a tough character."
"This wine is soft and juicy with 12 months in barrel. It has rounded tannins and perfumed berry fruits. What it misses is the acidity, leaving an unbalanced wine."
"The wine is all toast and smoky wood flavors though it spent only six to eight months in oak. It is extracted and hard, with little fruit."
"Overripe, jammy fruits and dry tannins are an odd combination. They don't work in this wine that has a hot character. This is the first vineyard in Blaye certified by Terra Vitis for sustainable viticulture."
"Vanilla and caramel flavors dominate this wine after 12 months in French oak. That means that the fruit is really not allowed to shine. It is firm, very dry and all about spice. A pepper flavor from the alcohol leaves a burn in the mouth."
"The over-exuberance of wood aging spoils this wine. With strong spice and equally tannic elements, it's all about the skeleton and not about the flesh of the fruit."
"The wine is ripe and soft with a body of tannin that sits uneasily within this jammy character. The blend (Merlot 75%, Cabernet Franc 25%, Malbec 5%) was aged 30% in barrel and 70% in stainless steel tanks. It is unbalanced and likely to remain so."
Juicy and spicy flavors give a wine that layers fruit and ginger. Blackberries are the dominant fruit while the spice adds a bite that is almost exotic.
"The wine is perfumed, spicy with dense tannins. It has a hard-edged structure, tough with the ripe fruit still underneath. Vines are an average of 14 years old."
"Smoky and toasty, this is a structured wine. It has layers of black currant fruits, fresh acidity as well as firm tannins that overlay the juicy fruitiness. It needs to age. Drink from 2016."
"Firm and dry, it's packed with as much tannin as fruit. It has a dark, structured character that's shot through with mint and black currant flavors. The aftertaste is dense and solid. Drink from 2017."

"Bright and fruity, it has soft tannins layered with black currant fruitiness and a dry core. It's juicy, ripe and developing well. Drink from 2016."
"This wood-laden wine shows more toast than fruit at this stage. It does have plenty of blackberry flavors for the future, giving texture to the firm structure. Drink from 2016."
"This dry wine is strongly dominated by tannins. It is structured, firm and hard-edged. Without the fresh acidity at the end, it would be a tough proposition."
"Very firm tannins dominate this potentially ripe, juicy wine. So while it is structured with some bitter chocolate flavors from extraction, it also has red berry fruits and fresh acidity at the end. It will mature quickly, so drink from 2016."
"A rich wine that has weight, solid tannins and ripe black currant flavors. It conveys a strong sense of structure without losing sight of a stylish fruitiness and firm texture. With acidity cutting through the richness, it will age well. Drink from 2016."
"The wine has some of the typical freshness of 2011 but it seems on the thin side. Black currant flavors run alongside high acidity, and the tannins show strongly. The aftertaste brings out more tight, mineral acidity."
"An attractively aromatic wine, full of open fruitiness. It has layers of black currant fruit that go with the fresh acidity, plus a touch of herbs that are followed by firm tannins. Juicy and ready to drink from 2015."
"Hugely tannic, this formidable wine has great weight, richness and a dark and dense structure. Juicy berry fruits, sweet plum flavors and a dry, concentrated backdrop promise aging. Drink from 2018."

"Showing the rich fruit of the vintage, it has warm red berry juiciness and an added smoky flavor. The wine is round yet still structured enough to balance its ripe surface. Drink this wine soon, best from 2015."
"A smooth, rich wine, it is full of opulent black fruits. It has weight, solid tannins and a great juicy swather of fruitiness. Aromatic and ripe, it is already developing well. Drink from 2017."
"Serious and tannic, this wine is slow to show its virtues. It does have black currant and plum juice flavors that are coming through the dense, dry structure. It needs to age, so don't drink before 2017."
"This big, ripe, Merlot-dominated wine has great black fruits that envelop the firmer, smoky tannins. Generous and rich, it's already an attractive wine but one which will age. Drink from 2016."
"A dry, tannic wine that is firmly structured. A sense of extraction masks the light and fresh black currant fruitiness. Give it until 2017 to soften."
"This ripe, fruity, juicy wine shows both the richness as well as the freshness of the vintage. Forward and fruity with black currants and red berries, it's already a delicious wine with dry tannins lending some structure . Drink now."

"Light, fruity and fragrant, this is an attractive, crisp wine that highlights red-berry fruits and soft acidity. It's a wine to drink now."

"The wine develops slowly in the glass, closed at first and then bringing on ripe fruits and firm tannins. There is a definite dryness here, solid, textured and darkly structured. It is meant for aging, so don't drink before 2016."
"Soft for the vintage, here is a wine that has a ripe, opulent feel. Its tannins are fully integrated into the rich, forward blackberry fruits that are ripe and generous. The wine is not for long-term aging. Drink until 2019."
"This is a solid and structured wine that is lightened by its juicy acidity. Black currant fruits dominate, giving a fresh character to the wine. The tannins that show through do promise medium-term aging. Drink from 2014."
"Possibly too rich, this is a full, sumptuous wine. It has great weight, density, a smooth, wood-aged character that shows through the sweet plums. For what it is, a very rich wine that shows some pepper alcohol-it offers a juicy character and ageability. Drink from 2016."
"This rich and integrated wine is full of ripe berry fruit and firm tannins. It is a full, concentrated wine, densely textured and structured. There is a good sense of juiciness behind the youthful, firm surface. Give this fine, great-value wine at least four years."
"A rich, bold wine full of wood flavors that are already well integrated with the ripe fruit and solid tannins. The wine is dense, while having a surface polish of smooth fruitiness. Give the wine 3-5 years."
"Ripe and sweetly fruity, this is a black-currant and berry-flavored wine, with balanced juiciness and a judicious use of wood. Full-bodied, it's likely to age well over the medium term."

"This balanced, juicy, fruity wine has refreshing red-berry fruit as well as solid tannins to back it up. An already attractive wine, this fruity number is likely to age quickly."
"A big, ripe and juicy wine packed with black fruit notes and laced with acidity. The tannins offer a contrast to the fruitiness, bringing balance and structure. This is an impressive wine, the smoky aftertaste bringing out the wood aging."
"Densely tannic while also fruity, this is a product of ripe fruits that give a black currant flavor as well as a solid structure. The acidity gives great lift to the end of this finely made wine."
"A packed wine, its ripe fruits are a warm pleasure. It has all the structure of the year but in fine measure, lending density and richness to the palate. It's a wine for aging; give it at least five years."

"While it has sufficient tannin, the wine also has a feeling of generous black currant and berry fruits. It's dry with considerable concentration, but it's future looks good, so keep for 5-6 years."
"This mint- and new-wood-flavored wine boasts ripe tannins and lush fruit. It feels weighty, perhaps almost too rich, while the tannins have a bitter-chocolate edge to them."
"Dusty tannins push to the front, resulting in a firm, wood-aged wine that shows smokiness, ripe blackberry flavors and a firm core. This should be at its best in 2-3 years."
"A dry, very firm wine, currently dominated by hard tannins. Woody flavors and a dense texture are present characteristics, with the fruit less in evidence. It could soften, because there is a hint of juiciness at the end."

"A diffuse wine without focus. The tannins and the fruit are some way apart, while the final flavor is dry and tough."
"Bell peppers and green herbs as well as dark tannins are the main characters of this very dry, bitter wine."
"The fruity, perfumed character shows instant red berry aromas, but the old-wood flavor doesn't quite chime with the fruit, giving a slightly muddled feel to the wine."
"Mint aromas speak of the wood used in aging this wine. With some burnt tannin character, it's perhaps not a wine that will show great fruit."
"Earthy aromas are an off-putting start to this heavily tannic wine. It tastes bitter and extracted, the fruit worked too hard during fermentation."
"Very dry and hard, with lean black currant fruits. This is likely to remain a tough and extracted wine."
"This wine has an unusual candy-flavored character. Its tannins are fine, and there is structure, but the final character is unbalanced."
"A firm and tannic wine, with a hard-edge feel to it. The structure is dry and tough, leaving little room for the fruit, even in the future."
"High acidity cuts through this wine from the get-go. The tannins also show a hard edge. This is a wine for the future, always with a sense of austerity and minerality."
"Almost too fruity, the wine has red berry fruits in profusion. What is missing is the tannin to hold it together, making this a fruity wine to drink soon."
"This is a wine for short-term aging. It is rich and juicy, deliciously fruity right now. Give it 2-3 years to enjoy its black fruits and fresh acidity."
"This wine has a smoky character and a subtle touch of wood, along with firm tannins and red fruits. Age this for 1-2 years."
"This is an attractively perfumed wine, which is polished by the wood influence, offering flavors of mint and eucalyptus. It is rich and spicy, with the weight of black fruits. This is already drinkable, so consume it now, or keep it for 3-4 years."
"While this wine has the richness and warmth of its vintage, it also has a fine, dusty, tannic structure, which gives it a serious aspect. Ripe black-plum and berry flavors provide a generous feel, while the crisp acidity offsets the ripeness."
"This black-fruited effort is laced with a spicy wood note. It's surprisingly delicious now, considering the firm tannins that compose its core, but the wine also promises some aging. Drink now for fruit, and age for more complexity."
"New wood, mint and eucalyptus aromas lead to a palate that is dominated by wood. With the rich fruit underneath, the wine will come into balance, becoming warm and generous, typical of the vintage."

"Very structured wine that shows its wood aging as well as textured black plum fruits. It has spice, toast and a smoky character. Underneath are blackberry fruits and a strong layer of acidity. Age for 3-4 years."
"Elegant, rich and fruity, with just the right amount of tannic structure. The wine has black currant, sweet acidity and a dense and concentrated texture. While it is rich, it also has a good long, elegant aftertaste."
"Rich, wood-aged wine, smooth and ripely fruity. Aromas of mint lead to the polished, ripe, elegant fruit, the tannins surrounded by a comfortable fruit texture. It will age over 4-5 years."
"Big, structured tannins lie over the ripe fruit. The wine has a dense character, the young tannins dominant. Given a year, the fine fruit will come through to give a sweeter blackberry character."

"When Jean-Luc Thunevin, master garagiste and creator of Saint-Emilion Château Valandraud, gets his hands on making a branded Bordeaux wine, it's worth taking notice. And this Merlot-dominated wine, distributed jointly with Bordeaux négociant Calvet, is the sort of wine that simple Bordeaux should taste like. It is smooth, ripe, concentrated, packed with red berries and attractive, forward fruit flavors, and yet with just the right layer of tannin to make a fine food partner. There is nothing complicated-leave that to the grand Châteaux. This is just a great drink."
"Branded Bordeaux has a deservedly spotty reputation, but this year's Mouton Cadet aims to start turning that around. Cherries and chocolate on the nose, followed by smoky, earthy tobacco and black-cherry flavors. A silky texture makes it ready to drink now."
"This shipper's blend is plump yet structured, boasting an herbal lattice of flavors draped over a base of black cherry and berry. Modest tannins and firm acidity provide grip to the finish"

"Malesan is the bestselling Bordeaux brand in France, and this wood-aged version shows the French have got it right. With the quality of the 2000 vintage to help it along, it is ripe, packed with black currant flavors and ripe acidity plus just a touch of wood. Anybody in Bordeaux should visit the Malesan cellar, which is like a football ground, with the tasting room set out on a stage in the central pitch, surrounded by tiers of barrels instead of spectators."
"Quite herbal, with some green beans and anise up front. Black fruit takes a back seat but is there if you look for it. Blackberry and beach plums come to mind. The tannins are a bit rustic. Kosher"
"There is a sense of pent-up energy with this wine. It has powerful fruit along with flavors of chocolate, but it is all masked and repressed by tight firm tannins. A wine that will develop slowly."
"For the vintage, this is an austere style of wine, emphasising tannins over fruit. The fruit is certainly rich, and the tannins are dusty rather than dry, but it is a wine which is developing more slowly, suggesting it is also a wine for long-term aging."
"The Cathiards have made a polished wine with generous fruit. It manages to combine a modern, rich style with a lightness of touch and freshness of fruit which make it instantly attractive."
"A rich, open modern style of wine, full of new wood flavors. The fruit is solid, chunky and square, while the tannins are ripe and generous. This will develop relatively quickly, over the next 10 years."
"Huge, deep purple-black color, and aromas of rich, spicy fruit give a sense of great power to this superbly intense wine. Liquorice and rich tannins suggest complexity, while subtle acidity adds refinement."
"Sometimes it seems as if La Mission is as good as Haut-Brion - that was certainly the case in 2001. But in 2000, La Mission fitted more comfortably into its usual good neighbor slot. That is not to suggest it is not a great wine - the score indicates that. At the moment, it is closed, solid and chunky, but all the right hints are there, and it will develop slowly and in a sustained way over many years."
"For an Haut-Brion, this is huge. Every characteristic suggests power, from the dark color, through the knock-out perfumes, full of dark, brooding fruits. The flavors are black, intense and ripe. It is a delicious wine, surprisingly ready to drink. And yes, just at the end, there is a small hint of the delicacy and elegance that is true Haut-Brion."
"Mushroom and plum aromas followed by coffee and black plum flavors. Hot, heavy and over the top."
"A dense, concentrated fruit with a good balance of wood and fruit. There is a slight touch of stalkiness but the fruit is also rich, with flavors of fruitcake and good structure."
"André Lurton's top red has dark, black color and sweet, rich perfumed fruit. The tannins are concealed under the richness, but they are there. A flavor of mint gives a touch of freshness."
"Jean-Louis Despagne has made a deep, dark-colored wine from his flagship property. It is polished and smooth, with rich fruit that is still dominated by wood at this stage, but with powerful dark fruit flavors underneath. This is a wine with great intensity and the chance to age for at least 10 years."
"There are aromas of ripe, juicy fruit. To taste, the wine is soft, juicy, and easy, perhaps slightly dilute. A very approachable wine, but in the end lightweight."
"Currently this wine is much too dominated by wood. There is some dark, tarry fruit, but the wood is ever-present. Buy this wine if you like wood flavors, the question is whether the fruit is powerful enough to come through."
"A soft wine, with ripe fruit and sweet wood aromas. The fruit is ripe, with a rich, juicy character and sweet fruit flavors. This is a wine that's already ready to drink."

"""Old vines"" means different things to different people. In this case, the fruit comes from vines that average 25-30 years old in the Cotes du Bourg and the Cotes du Blaye. The wine is fruit-focused (black cherries and cassis) but relatively light-bodied, finishing with lemony acids."
"Black cherries and chocolate combine on the palate, but there's also a certain weediness to the aromas. This blend of approximately 60% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon finishes strong, with tart fruit and a dose of chocolate."
"Smells plummy and ripe but tastes of bright cherries and shows a lean, claret-style mouthfeel. It's a little thin, but still manages to provide pleasure. Finishes with tasty mocha and toast shadings.  White Wine"
"Despite coming from a universally hailed vintage, this generic Bordeaux is still weedy, herbal and lean. But it also has decent cassis and cherry fruit, some tasty vanilla and cinnamon notes from oak aging, and a tart, dry finish. It's light, but it hasn't been dumbed down for the mass market."
"Almost black in color. Hugely rich, ripe bouquet with dark fruits. A hint of tobacco, plus structured tannins and acidity give the wine shape. The richness and depth of fruit are here, but so also is the ability to age. Give this 10 years before matruity."
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Malbec produced only in good vintages, this year's Verdillac is light but charming. It begins with earthy, blackberry and smoke aromas, and while the tannins are pretty fierce, there's some underlying good fruit. The finish is bitter and requires rich foods."
"This solid Bordeaux achieves a nice balance between ripe fruit and a more austere earthiness. There's a solid core of blackberry flavor and firm, broad tannins that suggest it will develop more depth with near-term cellaring."
"Most everyone's first Bordeaux is back for another year, with fruity black-cherry aromas spiked with just a touch of vanilla and cedar. Juicy acidity keeps this crowd-pleaser lively through the lightly tannic finish. A good introduction to the genre."
"A négociant bottling from the ubiquitous Yvon Mau, this wine proudly boasts élevé en futs du chene on the label. You can certainly notice it in the cedary aromas and flavors, but it's adequately balanced by cassis and tobacco flavors. The fruit tastes a touch overripe, but it seems to work well here."
"This is very light, in both flavor and body. The aromas are earthy, with a faint suggestion of blackberries, and the mouthfeel is thin. These aren't terrible flaws, but the wine just lacks substance."
"This is very light, in both flavor and body. The aromas are earthy, with a faint suggestion of blackberries, and the mouthfeel is thin. These aren't terrible flaws, but the wine just lacks substance."
"I know Bordeaux isn't known for being fruit-driven, but this paucity of fruit in a wine that's 50% Merlot (from a vintage that favored this variety's development) is hard to fathom. Leather and old wood combine with earth and mushrooms. There's decent weight and intensity here, so if these are flavors you look for this is an example to seek out."
"There are soft grapefruit-peach aromas and flavors, tart lime notes and a medium body here. It's not complex, but it's not supposed to be. It has no bad marks at all, and even a little length to show. A good bar pour or gallery opener."
"Straightforward, perhaps even simple, but once again well-made inexpensive juice. At 80% Merlot, it is soft with berry and hint of tobacco predominating. The light fruit has pleasant cocoa shadings, and it has a poised finish with mild tannins."
"This opens with a mature, even big bouquet displaying berry, leather, tobacco and bell pepper notes. It shows red-currant fruit, an earthy, briary character on the palate and a spicy, nicely complex finish. A taste of decent Bordeaux from a good vintage, with a touch of age. Drink now."
"A Merlot-Cabernet blend that starts out a little awkward and then really finds its legs. This is a perfect ""beginner's"" Bordeaux, in that it's fruity, clean and precise. The lack of complexity and high-end nuances doesn't hurt it at all. A little overoaked, but with airing out it tastes quite good. And it has the stuffing to match with hearty foods. Best Buy."
"Puts to shame a lot of California wines in the same price category. It has earthy, mushroomy and dried black-cherry aromas, with the same flavors. Soft and drinking well now, and will hold over the next three to four years."
"This ripe, bold and generous Gonfrier Fréres wine is ready to drink. Some firm tannins and a ripe texture are balanced with the juicy black-currant fruits. Drink now, although even better from early 2018."

This wine has a jammy character with acidity that is unbalanced. Wine is made in cement tanks and aged in cement tanks and new and up to three-year-old French oak barrels.
"The new wood and spice flavors still show in this wine. A dry, woody character is still keeping the fruit back. Black coffee flavors show that there was heavy extraction. This 20-acre property is one of four in the greater Saint-Émilion area owned by the Lannoye family."
"This lean wine, all acidity and tannins, has a severe character that is not likely to go away. The estate has been handed down from mother to daughter for seven generations and now owned by enologist Marie Laure Latorre. It was named for the Merlot plot planted on 08/11/99, the date of the last total solar eclipse seen in France."
"This wine has fruit but it is overwhelmed by the darkly tannic structure. It is concentrated and dense, with signs of extraction giving a hard edge. The Aubert family has been on the Bordeaux Right Bank for two centuries and currently owns six estates. Consulting oenologist is Michel Rolland."
"While this wine is still dense and tannic, it also has great layers of blackberry and black plum fruits that give richness. So although it is structured, it is also full and ripe, hinting at a delicious, generous future. Drink from 2018."
"This is a perfumed wine full of attractive black currant and spice flavors. The wood aging has given a great fillip of richness to the stalky fruit as well as rounding it out. It could age further, so drink from 2017."
"The second wine of Château de Belcier, this is still young, showing dense and dusty tannins over dark wood aging. It is dry, stalky with black currant acidity and a tight, firm aftertaste."
"Firmly tannic, this tough wine shows signs of over-enthusiastic extraction. That gives a bitter character that will always leave the wine with a dry core. The black fruits skins give acidity and some final freshness. Drink from 2018."
"This ripe and fruity wine has attractive blackberry flavors along with a smoothness that comes from wood aging. The tannins give just the right amount of structure, balancing this juicy wine. Drink from 2016."
"Ripe, soft and very drinkable, this has a generous structure that cushions the tannins with rounded black fruits. The acidity and the warm, generous character of the 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc blend net a fine representation of the fruity 2012s. This is Bordeaux consultant Stéphane Derenoncourt's home turf. Wooden fermenters and 16 months in barrel (40% new) necessitate time, so drink from 2016."
"The wine has serious tannins and firm fruit that give an austere character at this stage. But it will develop and round out into a rich wine with ripe black fruits, always with a solid tannic structure. Owner Juliette Bécot manages the technical side here with consultant Jean-Philippe Fort from the Michel Rolland lab, and manages marketing at classed-growth Château Beauséjour-Bécot in nearby Saint-Émilion."
"Chosen from a selection of parcels, this dense and complex wine has layers of firm tannins that a give a dry, tough core. Underneath, the juicy, currant and berry fruits need to spring to life. Give this concentrated wine until 2017."
"Layered with toasty wood, this rich wine delivers blackberry fruits, a strong sense of tannins that enrich the fruit, and a concentrated aftertaste. From one of several small properties tended by owners Christophe and Marie Jo Lavau, it will age well. Drink from 2017."
"Packed with wood and fruit, this rich wine needs time. A juicy blend of 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, it's full of attractive acidity and blackberry fruits. The tannins do need to soften and round out, so drink from 2017."
"This juicy Merlot/Cabernet Franc blend is balanced and fresh with great red fruits and soft tannins. Acidity gives a crisp flavor while the fragrant smokiness allows for future development. This comes from a nine-acre, high-density, hand-picked parcel on a limestone plateau among the Querre family vineyards. Drink from 2017."
"The wine is all fruit initially and then the firmer tannins kick in. It has a strongly tannic core that leaves the wine dry and tough after 12 months in barrel. The fruit weight should broaden the wine out, giving black fruitiness in the future. Drink from 2017."
"The Cabernet Franc in the blend gives an attractive perfumed character. Spice and pepper go with ripe black plum fruit flavors. It's dense and concentrated, the tannins prominent at this stage. Drink from 2017."
"Bold and ripe, this is packed with red fruits and fresh acidity from an 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc blend. While the tannins are present, they have a walk-on part, leaving the stage for the rich and juicy fruits. That makes it a wine to drink soon, from 2016."
"Ripe and fruity, this is a soft wine with attractive red fruits. With balanced acidity, it is round and fresh, with enough tannins to give support. Aged in one- and two-year-old barrels, it is quite ready to drink with a bright, red berry aftertaste. Consultant Michel Rolland works with Silvio Denz, who owns several Saint-Émilion-area properties and is a négociant elsewhere in Europe."
"Solid, dry and very tannic, this is a firm 75% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Franc wine. Flavors of licorice and oak aging (40% new oak) point to a dense and tough wine that needs to soften. It has acidity and layers of black fruits at the back. Hold this wine, with its potential, until 2017."
"Ripe and spicy, this is developing into an attractive wine. Plenty of fresh raspberry and black currant flavors go with the dusty tannins that are at the center of the wine. It does need to age; drink from 2016."
"The wine's strong toasty character is balanced by the potential of the ripe fruit and acidity. It's still showing as young, the wood aging covering the fruit. Wait until 2017 and the balance will be right there. This Cuvée is harvested from des Demoiselles plots, one of 13 chateaus in the Ducourt family."
"Very fruity, very juicy, this wine is all about crisp, fresh fruitiness, starting with hand-picked biodynamic vineyard plots and gravity-flow into the winery. Red currants dominate, with considerable acidity right at the fore. At the back, the tannins are developing, but fruit will be the hallmark for the long future. Owner Thierry Valette's family also owns Château Troplong-Mondot in Saint-Émilion."
"Fresh and fruity, this is already very drinkable. Tannins could soften further, but the bright red fruits and acidity are juicy enough already. The mineral texture and fragrant aftertaste form a balanced combination. This Cuvée is selected from plots on the Beynat property."
"While there are plenty of tannins, this Merlot/Cabernet Franc/Cabernet Sauvignon blend also has a delicious, fruity character. The fresh acidity of the vintage is right there, balanced by black currant fruits and a dry core. It is developing well, and will be drinkable from 2016."
"This wine is light, juicy and with attractive red fruits brightened with acidity. The tannins suggest a little aging, but there is no need to wait. This Beynat property has been in the family since 1917."
"The second wine of Château Belcier is a firm proposition in its own right, with dark tannins and juicy black currant acidity. It's tight with some austerity that needs to round out. Drink from 2017."
"There is a strongly rustic character to this wine. The fruit seems to have disappeared. and the wine is tough right through. Maceration took place in traditional concrete vats; malolactic fermentation and aging in barrels, 25% new oak."
"Firm, tannic and hard, this tight wine has a solid core of dry wood. It seems over-extracted with its bitter coffee flavors. Fruit is hard to come by, although there is weight that could develop."
"This 100% Merlot from a small experimental vineyard is solid, firm and still young. It has a dense structure of tannins and wood aging, showing bitter coffee flavors and an austere character after 14 months in new French oak. It will likely remain a tough proposition."
"With too much smoky toast, this gives a hard, extracted feel with licorice rather than fruit. Tannins are dense and hints of juicy fruitiness only appear in the background."
"With attractive mint aromas, this polished wine balances structure and fruit. New wood shows through but it doesn't dominate the black fruits that give weight and ripeness. It shows the typical juiciness of the vintage. Drink from 2017."
"This very rich, wood-aged wine is dense and powerful. The power takes away from the natural balance of a Bordeaux, giving dark tannins that dominate. Spice from the wood is also a strong element. It will round out, but will remain very ripe."
"There is a strong showing of wood in this wine. Along with the ripe berry fruits and acidity, it shows good aging potential. Drink from 2016."
"Rich yet finely balanced, this wine has both ripe blackberry flavor as well as freshness. With such good structure and solid concentration, there is obviously ageing potential in this impressive wine. Drink from 2016."
"Dry, with dusty tannins and ripe fruit, this is a wine with considerable potential. The berry fruits have a balanced, juicy element, fine acidity and a strong texture. The wine is rich and full, while remaining fresh. Drink from 2015."
"Dry, firm and tannic, this is a wine with great potential. It has weight, ripe berry fruits and a solid character. Wood aging shows lightly, allowing the ripeness of the fruit to dominate. Drink from 2016."
"While structured and firm, this is a ripe and juicy wine. Its texture has some minerality, lending an edge to intensely youthful acidity. As the wine ages, all these elements will integrate well, so drink from 2016."
"With a medicinal hint, this is a wine that is all potential. At the moment, it is firm, dry and darkly tannic. The weight gives the promise, offering rich fruitiness in the future. Drink this impressive, concentrated wine from 2016."
"A structured wine, rich in both tannins and fruit, this wine gives a solid performance. Its black and red berry fruits are already balanced with the tannins, while the acidity lends a delicious lift. Delicious now, but best to wait until 2015."
"Rich and structured, yet full and concentrated, this wine has both dark tannins and ripe plum and berry fruits. The acidity streaks through the wine, lending freshness and good aging potential. Drink from 2017."
"This is a jammy, ripe wine that smells of the south of France. That gives warmth, richness and a full-bodied character. Black plums, luscious berries and light tannins all make for a wine ?that can be drunk now."
"This is a balanced wine that is quite ready to drink now. It has black fruits, soft tannins and a deliciously juicy character. It's full bodied, but has a lively, fresh acidity on the finish."

"This fresh and juicy wine is marked by berry fruits and acidity. It's bright and crisp in character, while also having weight and richness. With its soft tannins, it is ready to drink now."
"Structured, concentrated wine, showing the firm texture of the vintage with firm tannins balancing intense acidity. The wine has power-witness the alcohol-but this is contained in a more elegant texture. Best to age this wine for 4-5 years."
"Belcier is on the slope that continues east from Saint-Émilion. With this provenance, this single vineyard wine offers rich Merlot to go with the more structured Cabernet fruit. It has weight, the wood well judged and supporting the ripe fruit flavors. Age this wine for at least five years."
"Owned by the Barons of Montfort, its vineyard has produced a much less rugged wine than the formidable fortress suggests. The black currant flavors are present, along with stalky tannins. There is a smoky, wood element that comes through strongly at the end, so age this wine for 3-4 years."
"This is a very complete wine, with all the fruit and tannin elements in place. There's a fine and rich character here as well as a more austere, mineral side. The combination results in supporting tannins, dark fruits and good aging potential."
"A tough, dark wine, needing considerable aging to bring out its balanced fruits. It has the feel of a serious, impressive wine, dominated by powerful tannins. Underneath, the fruit is dark, brooding and firm. Give this wine at least five years."
"Sweetly fruity, this is full of attractive acidity and juicy black currant fruit. It's a wine that is developing fast; with its delicious fruits, it will be ready to drink soon."
There is tough concentration here that suggests a wine that needs aging; there's also fruit that hints at richness to come. A wine that has a good future.

"Fruity and juicy, this is an approachable wine for short-term drinking. There are hints of new wood, along with bright black currant flavors. It's crisp and juicy, packed with fresh fruits and a balanced structure."
"While there is a strong element of new wood in this wine, it also has plenty of ripe black fruits. So it makes a wine that is powerful, potentially complex in 4-5 years with richness and a solid, serious final character."
"A tough proposition at this young stage, but one which will definitely mature well, if slowly. There's power from tannins and fruit, both promising aging. Dark and dense, this hints at the juicy black fruits to come."
"Dark tannins are sustained by juicy blackberry fruit flavors. While the wine is very dry and firm at this stage, it has a good, if long-term, future."
"A softly juicy wine, this is missing structure while it has plenty of fruit. It's ripe, rich and juicy; a pleasure to drink in 2-3 years."
"Minty aromas go along with firm, barely bitter tannins. They dominate the wine, smothering the fruit and lending a burnt quality to the palate."
"A strongly wood-aged wine, very dark and brooding. It has high extract and concentration, with a flash of black pepper on the palate. Tough and finishing hard."
"Full bodied, structured and tannic while also fruity, this is fine example of the 2010 vintage. It's all structure at this stage, but it's going to be a full and ripe wine, although the alcohol does show through at the end in a pepper-driven moment."
"A minty, modern style of wine that also has too much extraction and wood tannin for its own good. It's hard edged, the fruit losing out in the process."
"Using fruit sourced from a 20-acre vineyard in Castillon, this is dominated by Merlot, with a touch of perfumed Cabernet Franc. It has an age-worthy structure, showing good balance, firm tannins and ripe fruit."
"This fruity effort from the hill vineyards behind Castillon has weight, structure and a style characterized by full and ripe red fruit. The tannins are cushioned by the generous fruit, and the wine will improve over the next four years."

"Soft, warm and smoky wine, this has a finely layered wood flavor to go with the black currant and red berry fruits. It's dry, yet warm and ripe, finishing with freshness."
"Structured wine, the smoky, juicy fruit flavors right up front with the dry tannins. It has good aging potential, its powerful density offering a firm, solid character. It is certainly young at this stage, the smoky wood character showing right through. Keep for 3-4 years."
"Mint and tannins feature in the initial flavor, then it opens out to show delicious blackberry juice fruit. The tannins are dry but integrate with acidity to give more serious aspect to this balanced wine."
A lean and underweight wine. It has some juicy fruit but it misses depth of flavor.
"Dense tannins and a solid, chunky character suggest a wine with richness. The black fruits are concentrated, with juiciness coming through over time. It has the ripe power of the 2009 vintage."
"The Despagne family have grand cru classé estates in Saint-Émilion. The same team makes the wine at this neighboring Castillon vineyard. The wine is structured and generous, richly endowed with dark tannins and opulent Merlot. It is a full-bodied wine, open and broadly textured. Drink from 2022."
"Located to the west of Castillon-la-Bataille, this vineyard is close in geography and style to Saint-Émilion. It delivers a rich texture from the ripe Merlot as well as generous, warm berry fruits. At the same time, the wine has a light touch of acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink this poised wine from 2021."
"With no added sulfites and from organically grown grapes, this bottling ventures into natural wine territory. However, it suffers from a tinny character that can affect these wines and shows some hints of volatility. The second bottle tasted was less volatile."
"Made without any wood aging, this wine is all about bright cherry fruit. It shows some stalkiness from the fruit along with plenty of juicy acidity, soft tannins and an easy, open character. Drink now."

"This lightly structured wine is all fruit. Its red berry flavors are already well integrated with the smoky tannins that form its core. It will, however, age quickly. Drink from 2019."
"Solid tannins mark this out as a wine that will need to age. Its structure dominates its black fruit, hiding it beneath a smoky, spicy character. Give it until 2020 before opening."
"This dense wine is dominated by tannins. However, rich fruit is also there beneath the structure, suggesting excellent potential. Drink from 2020."

With layers of rich wood from 12 months in 400-liter barrels and black-currant flavors, it is still developing. Drink from 2022."

"Big and bold, this is going to be an impressive Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend from a 2.5-acre plot on the Queyrens family estate. It has great red fruits and generous acidity, both of which are given a strong sense of structure by the tannins. At the moment, it is about potential, so wait until 2017."

"While the wine is all tannin and structure at this stage, the weight and rich fruit promise plenty of good aging potential. Wine producers for 10 generations, the Dulon family picks specific plots. This 60% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet France blend has juicy black fruits that will push forward to give a full wine with a fine presence. Drink from 2017."

"Big, dusty tannins dominate this rich and opulent wine. With black plum and juicy red berries, it is well balanced, the acidity cutting through to point up the richness. Very ready to drink, but it will age. Drink now and until 2020."
"French philosopher and writer Charles-Louis de Montesquieu once lived at the moated Château de la Bréde, hence the name of this wine. It is a ripe, finely perfumed wine, with new wood and eucalyptus aromas, rich red fruits and a soft, open series of tannins. It is almost ready to drink, but the chocolate edge suggests it should be kept until 2017."
"With strong new wood aromas, this concentrated wine shows vanilla as well as black-fruit flavors. Acidity cuts the richness, giving shape to wine and focusing on the balance. With firm tannins in the background, it needs several years. Drink from 2016."
"The aromas are of new wood and toast as much as fruit, and this follows on the palate. It has strong burnt-toast flavors along with a full textured palate. Blackberry fruits are under this weight of wood, and need several years to emerge, although the wine will always have a strong wood component. Drink from 2017"
"Packed with dark tannins, this complex wine shows a powerful structure allied with very fresh acidity and red berry fruits. It is still feeling its way, heavy on the texture and still waiting for the fruit. Drink from 2014."
"A dry style of wine that only slowly reveals its juicy character to bring out a warmer, richer side. It also does show considerable toast and spiciness along with firm tannins all of which still need to fully integrate. So don't drink until 2016."
"Rough around the edges, this is a dry and tannic wine. It has mint, red currant fruit and a dry center. It needs a year or two, but is likely to remain rustic."
"Solid, dark and extracted, this hard-edged wine has too many tannins and not quite enough fruit."
"A delicate wine that is completely ready to drink and needs to be consumed now before it ages further. The fruit has developed a secondary, animal character, the tannins starting to dominate with their dryness."
"Mushroom aromas indicate a wine that is now mature. It's light, textured with hints of green herbs as well as tannins that are now dry. Not for aging, drink now."
"This wine exhibits the generosity from the ripe 2009 vintage. It has rich, full and round fruits, with a pleasing black currant flavor and tannic edge. Juicy, with a dust-textured aftertaste, this will age for 4-5 years."
"Powerful tannins still control this wine. It has a mineral-driven texture and is very firm, and the dry core still masks the potential of its delicious, juicy black fruits. Solid and chunky, yet maintaining elegance, this is a wine for aging over at least six years."
"Maturing well, yet with plenty of aging ahead, this is a firm and fragrant selection. It has a ripe berry flavor and a hint of truffle, with sweet acidity and a dense, rich structure."
"Now maturing well, this is a wine that reflects much of the freshness of 2008, with firm tannins and solid structure. A black currant flavor dominates this elegant offering, providing acidity as well as freshness. It could age for another few years, but is ready to drink now."
"Chocolate and licorice flavors dominate this solid, foursquare yet austere wine. Its offers firm fruit, with a dense texture of black currant and red plum. Acidity and a spice note set off the finish."
"This spicy, full-bodied effort shows the generosity of 2009. It has firm tannins, but they are matched by the full blackberry and black currant flavors. The dry core from wood aging is likely to soften over the next 2-3 years."
"Here's a big, wood-laden wine that shows some bitterness, extraction and toast influence. However, the weight of ripe black-plum flavor will certainly come forward to produce a balanced, rich bottling, with the generosity of the year. Wait for 2-3 years."
"This is a light, fresh and fruity wine, with an attractive red-berry flavor, plus acidity and a soft structure."
"This wine veers between firm tannins from old wood and red fruit acidity, without finding balance. It's very dry, with a hard edge."
"This is a maturing, wood-aged wine, with smooth plum fruit and tannins, now maturing well. Through aging, a more tarry character is revealed, with some smokiness, while maintaining a ripe, wood-laden feel. Ready to drink now."
"The wine seems lean, austere and minerally in character. It has stalky black-currant fruits, firm tannins and forward acids. It should age over 2-3 years, but it will always be on the severe side."
"A finely structured wine with dusty tannins surrounded by attractive black currant fruits. Wood flavors give extra complexity to a wine that has fine juicy acidity and spice. Age for two years, but can be enjoyed now."
"Attractive fruity wine, its acidity leading to ripe red berry fruits and soft tannins. It is deliciously fresh, with stalky black currant and herbs throughout."
"Ripe wine, full of rounded juicy black currant fruits, this has a core of tannins, dry and laced with wood toast. There is a black chocolate bitterness which goes with the acidity on the finish."
"Well balanced wine, perhaps with the wood revealing too much, otherwise with fine red berry and currant fruits and dry fruit tannins. It has structure and great juicy acidity on the finish."
"A powerful, dense and still youthful wine. It balances a fresh blackberry fruit character with smoky tannins and delicious, bright and juicy acidity."
"The problem with this wine is the wood. There is too much of it, and the toasting is too high, giving a burnt character to the wine. For a 2005, this should be better integrated, and is likely to just dry out."
"This wine comes from an estate owned by the Lesgourgues family, which also produces Armagnac. This reserve wine is richly caparisoned with tannins and powerful black-plum and berry fruits. It is rounded, rich and has a great future. Drink this dense wine from 2023."
"A black-currant and spice-flavored wine, this comes from a parcel within the Fougéres vineyard. Aged in oak for 14 months, it has a smooth texture and a minty character that gives richness and style. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2022."
This richly structured wine is full of solid tannins and generous black-fruit flavors. Ripe berries and juicy acidity give a balanced counterpoint to the tannins. Wait until 2023 for this wine to fully integrate.
"Dense, rich with black fruits and lifted by acidity, this wood-aged wine comes from the northern part of the Graves appellation. It shows both the ripe fruit of 2015 and a black-currant character from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink from 2023."
"Rich, probably too rich, this is a smooth, concentrated wine. Its tannins are already embedded in the cushion of superripe fruit offering flavors of black plums and dark chocolate. The wine will age quickly; drink from 2019."
"Superripe Merlot, 60% in this blend, gives this wine power and density, with full-bodied black fruit and firm tannins. Wood aging, partially in new wood, has brought in spice as well as a dry core that indicates the potential of this wine as it matures. Drink from 2023."
"A 50/50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this shows big fruity flavors tempered with a dry core of tannins. There is a stalky element of black currant skins which adds to the sensation of dryness, but there is also a more mouthfilling character of black plum juice to give the wine a final roundness."
"The top Cuvée from Château Saint-Robert, dominated by new wood covering the attractive fresh berry fruits underneath. The wood, with its attendant spice, needs to blow away and integrate for the wine to come into its own."
"A big, ripe powerful wine, rich with black berry and sweet plum flavors. The wine shows density and tight, dark tannins that promise some good aging. The balance is finished with sweet and sour acidity and a concentrated finish."
"A firm, balanced wine, typical of the slightly austere mineral side of the Graves. The tannins are tight, binding a core of fresh berry fruits to bright and fresh acidity. The wine is balanced, finishing with spice and dark chocolate."
"It takes a while to get beyond the dry structure of this wine. But underneath that initially forbidding exterior, there is a solid core of ripe, sweet black fruits and an elegant balance with the acidity coming through to finish well. A wine for some aging-maybe 3-4 years."
"Big, rounded and fruity, very appropriate for the vintage, this is a smoothly polished style of wine, with mint and wood layers over the ripe blackberry fruits. It is dense, the tannins dusty rather than tight, the structure still very much to the front. It needs another year of aging."
"A firm, solid wine, with a red berry fruit core, sweet flavors, some bright acidity and dark, tight tannins. In other words, it's all there in a wine that could age for 2-3 years."
"Relatively lightweight, showing freshness rather than density, this is a fruity, red currant- and red plum-flavored wine that is lifted by a good use of wood aging, spice, and enclosed by vibrant acidity."
"From a large 177-acre estate in the southern Graves, this wine shows plenty of stalky, black currant fruits, fresh acidity and spice from wood. It has just the right characters for a food Bordeaux, dry core of tannins and vivid fruit around."
"Classically structured, which means dry tannins mixed with fresh black currant juice, and set over a bed of tight wood. This is a firm wine, perhaps lean for the vintage, but with a sense of balance and structure."
"An attractively balanced, fruity wine that shows to advantage the crisp lightness of 2007. There are red fruits, berries, raspberries, given structure by a core of dry tannins. The acidity and spice roll together in the final taste, with just an edge of green."
"Soft, lightweight, juicy, well-made wine, exhibiting some wood, spice, fresh black currant juice, and a tight core of tannins. There is no mistaking the cool vintage origins of this wine."
"A lean, somewhat austere wine that emphasizes tight tannins and minerality. The fruit is firm, but at the same time both slightly oxidized and edging towards green. The result is a set of flavors that definitely demands food."
"A wine that seems to be all tannin, all wood, with only a feel of black currant fruits underneath all this dryness. These flavors suggest high extraction, giving spice, a high toast wood character, all too much for a delicate 2007."
"This has richness, structure, a very direct style of Bordeaux. It shows spice, berry acidity, some appetizing sweet juiciness and a firm layer of dark tannins. The wine has good balance and richness, but finishes with plenty of fresh acidity."
"Dense fruit sets this wine off well. It has structure, ripe black plum juice and cranberry fruits, followed by sweet tannins as well as balancing acidity. The ensemble of fruit and tannins promises some aging-maybe 3 years, but with its richness it is drinkable now."
"A smooth, ripe wine, with eucalyptus aromas and layers of new wood. At the same time, it doesn't lose its origins, the structure of Cabernet and the ripeness of Merlot showing through well in a wine that has benefited from the 2005 conditions."
"A wine that is showing signs of maturity, emphasizing the sweetness of the rich vintage. It offers juicy spice, firm but sweet tannins and flavors of licorice and dark chocolate. It is ready to drink."
"For a 2003, this seems rather lean. The red fruits are turning mature now, and leaving some astringency behind. The wine is becoming herbal, with green pepper acidity. It's pleasant to drink, but is unlikely to develop."
"Fresh aromas of red fruits are immediately attractive, but the wine also has weight, with some rich, smoky fruits, edges of tobacco and dried fruits. The tannins give a definite firm structure, but are well padded by wood and ripe fruits."
"A smooth, creamy wine, rich in red fruits and rounded tannins. There's plenty of acidity but that just gives the delicious fruit character a good lift. Wood creeps in, playing a supporting role."
"This romantically named estate is owned by Emmanuelle and Bertrand Amart. The wine is an attractive mix of spicy, berry fruit and dry tannins, with a measure of fresh acidity thrown in. There is an intriguing smoky finish."

"This is a ripe, well-integrated wine that shows the charming, elegant side of Graves wine. Without great depth of flavor, it has attractive black berry fruits and soft tannins."
"Finesse is a wine created to exhibit elegance, showing restrained fruits, poised tannins and plenty of the trademark 2004 fresh acidity."
"Bel-Air is owned by the Cazes family of Château Lynch-Bages in Pauillac, and the pedigree of the winemaking shows. A rich, almost opulent wine, tempered with tannins. Flavors of dark black figs, herbs and wood come together harmoniously. It has a tense edge of tannin that promises aging."
"A rich wine that shows plenty of berry fruits, supported by some dry but dusty tannins. This is a wine that is going to develop with its firm powerhouse of ripe fruit that is emerging from a tight period in its development."
"While this wine shows some of the softness and richness of 2003, it keeps a light touch and the acidity and black fruits remain fresh. There is an edge of astringency that leaves a hard aftertaste."
"Densely tannic, this has edgy black currant flavor emerging between a firmly dry structure  packed with dark berry fruits and fresh acidity. This is light in fruit and heavy on tannins."
"The aromas and initial taste are all of new wood. Only later does some fresh red fruit appear, giving the wine a lift. There is enough fruit here, but this needs time for the wood to calm down. Then the wine will show the vibrancy the structure suggests."
"A stalky, lean wine with austere fruits. The tannins are dry and washed in acidity. It's firm, structured, hinting at some juicy black currants. There's some spice and smokiness from the wood."
"Firmly structured, full of juicy red fruits and fresh currants. The tannins are dry, but dusty, floating in the blueberry fruity character. Good acidity, structure and smoky elements from the wood. This is well-made Bordeaux at a good price."

The wine is firm, tannic, with true black currant flavors and some solid layers of wood. A very good benchmark Bordeaux. Imported by Bayfield Importing Ltd."

"This wine is fresh, with hints of ripe fruit and aromas of tobacco. It has some darkness, good black fruits and dark tannins, along with some good smoky wood."
"La Tour Carnet is a reliable cru bourgeois; this second wine is correspondingly less impressive. The aromas are muted, and the flavors tend toward earthy notes and sour cherries, with rugged tannins on the finish."

"A wood-laden wine, it still manages to bring out its inherent fruitiness. It's a ripe wine, showing spice from the wood and juicy blackberry flavors, well packaged and finished off with acidity. Drink this attractive wine from 2016."
"A firm and structured wine, it has solid tannins to partner the black currant fruits. A bitter flavor comes from extraction, giving a burnt character that spoils this big wine. Drink from 2017."
"Firm tannins are supported by rich fruitiness to give a wine that is ripe and developing well. It has weight, spicy black fruits and integrated tannins. It's will mature quickly, so drink from 2015."
"Very classic in style, it has firm tannins that come before black currant fruits. Its structure is dry, lightly smoky from wood aging and with a crisper fruit character underneath. The tannins need to soften before the wine can be drunk with pleasure, so wait until 2017."

"Ripe, juicy and relatively soft, it's a great wine for early drinking. The black currant fruits are rich, soft, just cut by the acidity and with smoky tannins that lie comfortably underneath. Drink from 2016."
"This wine is all structure and dark, dry tannins. The fruit is very subdued, giving a hard wine that could well remain tough."
"Closed up and firm, the wine is not showing much in the way of expressive fruitiness. It does have a firm structure, but a taste of bitter extract gives hard tannins and smothers the black currant fruit flavors. In time, it will soften. Drink from 2017."
"The wine is hard, tough and dense. Its tannins are solid, dominant, extracted and cover any fruit. It is likely to remain dry."
"In this light and fruity wine, gentle tannins underlie ripe black currant fruits. It is almost drinkable already, and will age quickly. Drink from 2015."
"A lean wine, hard-edged and with austere tannins. It has some berry fruits that are submerged by the tense tannins and acidity. At the end, smoky wood aging flavors dominate."

"An austere, structured wine, this is dominated by strong wood flavors. It has dark chocolate, bitter tannins with the fruit element submerged. At this stage, it doesn't have the weight to fully integrate fruit and structure."
"There seems to be too much wood here which is smothering the fruit. Given that, the wine does have weight and as the wood softens, the juicy fruit flavors should come through. Wait to drink until 2016. But it will always be austere."
"Dry and serious, this firm wine is classic Bordeaux. It has weight, a core of tannins and black currant fruitiness that needs time to fully integrate with the dense structure. Give this exemplary wine another five years."

"Big, rich and bold, this is a finely concentrated wine that's marked by the freshness of the year. It's likely to develop quickly and be ready next year."

"This is dark and firm, with sufficient fruit to promise a rich future. The wine has ample weight, a solid, dense core and a juicy outer layer. Good for 3-5 years."

"Juicy but not quite ripe, this is a green and herbal wine that is not worth aging. Drink it over the next few years."

"Liversan is the flagship of the properties owned by the Lapalu family. In 2010 it has produced a complex, tannic and dark-fruit-driven wine that is full, ripe and solidly structured. Rich, with a dry core, it has the potential to age for at least 5-6 years."
"There is a fine mineral texture to this structured, firm wine from the northern Haut-Médoc. It also has ripe fruit and a richly tannic character, with flavors of black plum juice and berry. Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, this will age over several years."
"This small 24-acre property has produced a powerful, rich 2010 that layers its big black-plum flavor with complex tannins and wood notes. Dry and firm, it is still defiantly young and needs several years to round out."
"This is a rich wine still dominated by solid, firm and dry tannins. Its black and red fruits are ripe and juicy, and its freshness comes from acidity that appears on the finish. Age this balanced effort for 4-5 years, at least."
"As Belgrave improves each year, it reveals a character that is close to the elegance and style of Saint-Julien, right next door. This 2010, while dense, is balanced, and its rich blackberry flavor is already integrating into its firm tannins. This should age well for the medium term."
"Gironville is in the southern Haut-Médoc, close to Margaux, and is capable of producing the same style of wine-open and not overly tannic. At the same time, the black currant fruit is present, concentrated and already juicy. This shows fine potential, so keep it for the next 4-5 years."

"By Médoc standards, this 7-acre vineyard is small, with a production of 1,150 cases. The powerful blackberry flavor is sweetened by dark plum and licorice notes, structured with new wood influence and firm tannins. There is a juicy finish, and the tannins promise long-term aging."
"Now mature, this is a powerful wine for the vintage. It has a spice note, plus tannins that are still present and likely to develop further. The flavors of truffle, gamy beef and beet are are testaments to the age of this wine. It needs to be consumed over the next year."

The tannins are firm and dry, which dominate the black currant flavor, and the acidity is crisp and plentiful. It's a wine that is aging slowly and will repay several more years of aging."

Age for another year, but also drink now."

It is pure black currant fruit, understated yet beautifully balanced. The acidity pierces through the dry fruit tannins. The wine finishes with just a hint of wood."

"A smooth wine that softens well, but that still retains rich fruits and dense, dusty tannins. There is good power here, from blackberry and red plums, the texture of velour. Drink now and over the next 3-4 years."

"All tannin, this wine is missing fruit, although the acidity hints at some fading freshness. It is tough and dry, not offering much real pleasure."

"Good density here, with tannins that spring from bright berry fruits. The acidity is certainly present, but it has weight behind it, giving potential richness balanced by wood."
"The continuing improvement at classed growth Camensac under the ownership of the Merlaut family (Chasse-Spleen, Citran, etc) is apparent even in the lesser vintage of 2007. The structure hangs well with the stalky but solid black berry fruit, the acidity a pure streak through it. Age over 4-5 years."

"This wine comes from a 10-acre estate that is run by the same team as the much larger Château Larose Trintaudon, helping explain its quality and the richness. It has broad tannins, ripe blackberry fruit and a generous, succulent character. It should be aged further so drink from 2024."

It has weight but its main thrust is elegance, with stylish black-currant fruit, acidity and a dry core from the wood aging. The wine will age well and should not be drunk before 2023."
"With the huge investment of the Edmond de Rothschild family, it is no surprise that this is the most powerful Listrac wine. This is rich, hugely dense, and very ripe. The tannins are more dusty and soft than usual Bordeaux, but that is the year. Vanilla and grilled almonds show through as the wine finishes. A successful wine that should age well. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd."
"With 44% of Cabernet Sauvignon and an equal amount of Merlot, this wine perfectly expresses the relatively cool vineyards of Listrac. It has structure, tautness and fine, violet perfumes and layers of spicy wood. Fine, clean acidity suggests good aging potential. Imported by Carolina Wine Co."
"A wine initially dominated by wood, but opens to show ripe, black fruits, flavors of herbs and firm, dry tannins. From an 88-acre vineyard in the west of Listrac, this is a finely structured wine, which will certainly age well. Imported by Heidelberg Distribution."
"Partly owned by New York resident Peter M. F. Sichel, this is a property that has considerably improved. This 2003 has richness, some good new wood flavors and and an open character. The fruit is packed with ripe, black flavors and there is softness to the aftertaste that is immediately appealing. Imported by Parliament Wine Co."
"A smooth, vanilla-flavored wine that shows good black currant flavors. There are soft tannins, some wood notes, but there is also a stalky dryness in the background. The aftertaste leaves wood and dry fruit in equal proportions. Imported by Wine Frog."
"The full whammy of bacon and sweet smokiness on the nose announces that this wine was heavily oaked. And the tannins and lemony nuances that penetrate the palate and finish confirm that. In between there's ripe, blasting cherry fruit and acids that create a sweet-tart candy impression."
"This is a serious, complex wine from an estate that was created in the 1930s. Old vines and wood aging have give the wine concentration and richness. Black-plum skin and blackberry flavors, enhanced by a good proportion of Petit Verdot, dominate a wine that will age well. Drink from 2022."
"Owned by the Thomas family, this wine has an unusual blend of 50% Merlot and 35% Petit Verdot (with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon). It shows how Petit Verdot can now ripen easily in warm years. The dark color and dense tannins are a counterpoint to the juicy blackberry fruit. They will allow this wine to age well. Drink from 2021."
"This is a dense and tannic wine. It has plenty of the structure that is common to the Listrac appellation with a firm character when young; however, it also has swathes of ripe black fruits and acidity that will allow it to fill out very satisfactorily. Drink from 2020."
"Owned by the Borie family, one of the grand families of Bordeaux, the vineyard forms part of Château Fourcas-Borie. The wine, with its dark tannins and dense texture, is powerful and concentrated. Layers of tannins show most strongly at this young stage, while the ripe juicy fruit will develop well. It is going to be a fine wine. Drink from 2021."
There is plenty of Merlot in this ripe wine which is produced in the Listrac cooperative. Spice and attractive tannins give the wine structure and perfume. They contrast with the juicy blackberry fruits and fine crisp acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from 2021.
"The wine is lean with austere tannins and plenty of structure. What is seems to be missing is the fruit potential. It will soften over time, although probably not enough."
"Situated to the north of the village of Listrac, this estate is one of several that carries the name Dupré. The wine is dominated by Merlot (60%). That explains the wine's high alcohol and lush character. It also shows signs of firm extraction that has left a tough dry core. It will soften, but it will not lose its overwhelming richness."
"Situated on one of the highest points of the Médoc, this vineyard is on deep gravel soil. It is one of a group of properties owned by the Chanfreau family of Château Fonréaud. This wine is firm and still young. However, it is already showing signs of the ripe black fruits and wood aging. Acidity and the firm structure will let the wine age. Drink from 2020."
"This is a rich stylish wine from the Chanfreau family. It has fine tannins and signs of wood aging, both of which will meld into the juicy black-currant fruits. It has a predominance of Cabernet Sauvignon that gives the wine its structure and aging potential. The aftertaste is ripe and still crisp, still young. Drink from 2020."
The wine is ripe and full of blackberry fruits. It has serious tannins still although these are well balanced by the fruitiness. The firm structure and wood aging flavor will soften over the next few years. Drink from 2020.
"From one of the leading estates in Listrac, this is a ripe structured wine. It has firm tannins and a dark core of dry wood aging. Balanced with that is the blackberry fruit and generous superripe Merlot. The wine needs time, so don't drink before 2019."
"Now at its peak, this is a rich, full-bodied wine. It has a fine blend of dark tannins and dense plum and berry fruits. Maturing well, the wine is well balanced, with a smoky edge and still with a touch of acidity. Drink now."
"The estate belongs to the Borie family, one of the grand names of Bordeaux, with the wine making done by the team of Château Ducru-Beaucaillou in Saint-Julien. The result is an aromatic, balanced wine that is both structured and fruity. It has fine tannins, black currant fruit and a perfumed aftertaste."
"Fonréaud's vineyard is on the highest point of the Médoc (all of 120 feet). This vintage shows a smooth, ripe wine full of juicy black fruits. It's not dense, and the fruitiness will let it age relatively quickly. Drink this attractive wine from 2018."
"This wine is full, structured and rich with tannins and black-plum fruits. The hints of 12 months wood-aging are still there, just beginning to soften and allow the fruit to fill out the wine. Juicy acidity at the end mingles with the tannins. The wine will age, so drink from 2018."
"This wine comes from one of a group of wineries with vines in the small area north of Listrac called Le Fourcas. It's packed with red fruits and juicy acidity. The dominant Merlot gives a bold, rich texture backed up by the more structured Cabernets. It will develop quickly and be ready from 2017."
"This wine is well balanced between its juicy black-currant fruits and dry tannins. The high percentage of Petit Verdot (20%) gives both the color and the firmer tannic background. It is beginning to age well, so drink from 2017."
"This well-made, ripe and fruity wine has soft tannins that are already well integrated with the red-berry fruits. Acidity keeps it all fresh and suggests the wine could age over the medium-term. Drink from 2018."
"Named after the outcropping of gravel on which the vines are planted, this second wine of Fourcas-Dupré is Merlot-based. With its smoky tannins and strong flavors of wood, it needs to fill out with the blackberry fruits that lie in the background. That won't take long and the wine will be ready to drink from late 2016."
"Fonréaud's vineyard is on the highest point in the Médoc (all of 120 feet), at the southern end of the Listrac appellation. This wine, as often with this property, has started out rugged and solid with firm dry tannins. The fruit though is all there and will show with increasing intensity over the next few years. Drink this powerful wine from 2018."
"While wood aging has given this wine a dry, firm core, it has also allowed the ripe black plum fruit flavors to develop well. The result is a rich wine, structured while also generously fruity. It is still coming together; wait until at least 2017 before drinking."
"This Merlot-dominant wine is dark and dense. The dry tannins and wood aging give spice as much as fruit at this stage. A more juicy black currant-flavored element should assert itself with time, so drink from 2018."
"Often richer than its stablemate, Château Fonréaud, Lestage in 2012 also has more obvious wood aging flavors. It's big and concentrated, dominated by smoky tannins. It's going to develop into a rich wine, packed with blackberry flavors and always a dry core."
"One of Bordeaux's more memorable labels (orange nymphs supporting a picture of the chateau), Saransot-Dupré is one of a number of chateaus in Listrac with the Dupré suffix. This is a solid wine, chunky in a typical way for the appellation with plenty of black fruits and balanced tannins. Drink from 2017."
"Smooth, rich and rounded, this is produced by the Listrac cooperative. Full of ripe, blackberry fruits, open tannins and a full, dense character, it's likely to be ready soon, so drink from 2016."
"This concentrated, structured wine has an earthy quality, typical of some Listracs, along with a more juicy, fruity character that's boosted by acidity. Balanced, it will age over the medium-term. Drink from 2017."
"From one of two properties in Listrac owned by the Thomas family (the other is Reverdi), this is seriously dark and tannic, with flavors of bitter chocolate extract and wood. It doesn't feel as if it will really soften enough."
"Initially rough around the edges, this wine opens up to give warm red berry fruits, firm tannins and a solid structure. Underlying tannins give a dry core. A more juicy, fresh aftertaste means this wine needs some aging. Drink from 2017."
"A lean wine, hard-edged and with austere tannins. It has some berry fruits that are submerged by the tense tannins and acidity. At the end, smoky wood aging flavors dominate."
"An unusually high proportion of Petit Verdot (30%) gives this wine both its color and its firm, dark structure. It's a rich wine, the tannins underlying ripe black plum skin flavors and a spicy aftertaste. Give this wine until 2016."
"A year's wood aging has left its mark on this wine in the form of burnt smokiness. However, the fruit is rich and full-bodied giving the promise that the wine will smooth out its rough edges. There already is a fine juiciness at the end that comes with great acidity."
"This is a dense wine, rather rough round the edges with some firm, tough tannins and bitter extraction. It does have good fruit weight underneath, suggesting that its black currant flavors will emerge. Drink from 2017."
"Smooth and rich, this showcases both the structure and ripe black fruits of the vintage. It has wood-aging flavors, with a touch of caramel and fine acidity. This is for medium- to long-term aging."
"A wine with structure, this achieves balance with its black currant flavor and acidity. It's lined firmly with tannins that bring a dry and texture to this solid, age-worthy bottle. Give it at least five years."
"With its rich, ripe blackberry-jam flavor and soft tannins, this is an immediately accessible, fruity wine. The tannins provide structure that accompanies the ripeness, although this is not a wine to age for many years."
"Here's a big, smooth, round wine, with tannins that are packed into the superripe fruit flavors. It is powerful and concentrated, and the wood influence is still prominent along with a touch of bitterness from overextraction. It needs time to fully integrate."
This is a very rich wine with black fruit and bitter coffee flavors and dense tannins. Its weight is almost too much for the firm structure that is underneath.
"With the rough edges and firm tannins of Listrac, this is a wine that will likely always be firm. Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, it has a black currant skin flavor, some wood influence and a dry texture. It may not age further, always staying tannic and solid."
"Still young, with its dry tannins, this is a wine that has developed depth and concentration over the last 3-4 years. It has power, the berry fruits driving through the structure to give a layered, attractive, serious finish."
"The hot, overweight 2003 vintage has not been kind to this licorice- and dark chocolate-flavored wine. It is dry, firm, while still garishly rich. If you have it, drink it now."
"Produced by the winemaking team of Château Ducru-Beaucaillou in Saint-Julien, this Borie family estate wine has been given a sophisticated touch. The wine is spicy, with wood aging evident but nicely judged. Ripe and fruity, with the potential from its tannins for aging, this is a wine to drink from 2022."
"At five years old, this wine is still young, with firm, extracted tannins still in place. They will not completely go, and this solid wine will remain densely structured. On the other hand, the black-currant fruit is there, adding a further element to the wine. It's a food wine. Drink from 2020."
"This rich wine comes from a historic estate in Listrac, dating to the 18th century. It offers tannins and a dry core as well as dark black fruits and acidity, giving the wine its structure and potential longevity. The wine will develop slowly and will be ready to drink from 2025."
"The Chanfreau family continues its skilled course with this ripe, full and rich wine. Tannins from both the fruit and wood are prominent, giving a dry character to this youthful wine. However, the rich black-currant fruit is developing well. This wine has a long-term future. Drink from 2025."
"One of the properties that forms the Chanfreau family's Listrac holdings, this 103-acre estate has produced a powerful, rich wine. With tannins still evident, it will obviously age. But ripe blackberry fruit gives the wine a juicy future. It will be ready to drink from 2025."
"Continuing the sequence of fine vintages from this estate, this wine is rich, dense and structured. It has plenty of tannins, as well as generous black-plum and spice flavors. Wood aging adds light toastiness and smooths out the fruit. Drink from 2025."
"The entry-level wine from this estate, this is soft and full of ripe strawberry flavors. Its light tannins and fruitiness go with a succulent texture to make a wine that is ready to drink."
"This 17th-century estate is on the plateau of Lussac, with 12 acres of silica and clay soil. The wine has a smoky edge along with perfumes from the Cabernet Franc in the blend. Its berry flavors, ripe tannins and cinnamon touch are rich and promise some good aging. Drink from 2022."
"This fruity, juicy wine offers some well-structured tannins. Aged in wood for 18 months, it is ripe, concentrated and full of black-currant and blueberry flavors. It is a wine with potential; drink from 2022."
"The 48% Cabernet Franc in this wine gives it a smoky perfume. Dry and still firm, the structure offers ripe tannins, hints of wood aging and fragrant blackberry fruits. The wine needs to age a little longer, so drink from 2020."
"This wine is dry, with some firm extraction that is masking the fruit. It is fruity and juicy but the bitter, dry edge is not helping the wine's natural fruitiness."
"Lussac is one of the so-called satellites of Saint-Emilion (villages that attach the magic Saint-Emilion name to their own). But it does have many attractive wines that emulate Saint-Emilion in every way except the high price. This wine, a blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc, with a combination of dry austere blackcurrant fruit and sweet tannins, has that evocative cigar box, tobacco flavor that marks out a good Saint-Emilion. It finishes dry, tannic and demanding either decanting or a few years' aging, but also ready to drink with food this holiday season."
"With its aromas and flavors of plum and leather and subtle hints of vanila, this is a supple, medium-weight Bordeaux that's ready to drink. No, it's not that intense or complex, it's just a pleasing mouthful of claret."
"Big and bold, this is a rich wine with firm tannins that are balanced by dense fruitiness. Spice, a dark texture and concentration hint at the extraction although this does not detract from potential of the fruit. Give this several more years before drinking, certainly don't try it before 2020."
"Owned by the same family since 1850, this estate has produced a ripe Merlot-dominated wine. It is densely structured and full of black-currant fruits. The crisp fruitiness of the year shows strongly. Drink from 2018."
"Produced from the best parcels of the estate, this is a dense wine that's full of ripe blackberry fruits. It is also firm and structured in a way that will allow it to age. The fruit is all there, solid and ripe and lit by final perfumed acidity. Drink starting from 2018."
"Owned by the Riviére family, which also owns a large negociant business, this estate has produced a solid darkly tannic wine. Dominated by Merlot, it is rich, juicy and full of blackberry fruits. The fresh acidity of the vintage is still very present. Drink from 2017."
"The wine is smoky, with black currant-fruits and a core of dry tannins. Those tannins are probably not going anywhere much, so while the fruit and acidity will soften, the wine will always be dry."
"The skill of Michel Rolland's wine-consulting team shows in this sophisticated, rich wine. The 90% Merlot dominates, but the ripeness is tempered by solid tannins, stylish black-currant flavors and a firm, ageworthy aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
"This blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc from just north of Saint-Émilion is still structured and firm. Big tannins and smoky flavors give a dense character. The black fruits still need time to round out and show smoothness. For now decant, or wait until 2017 to drink."
"Despite the high alcohol (typical of 2010), this is a finely wrought wine. New wood shows strongly in the aroma, along with espresso coffee. On the palate, the wood gives a smooth, polished feel to the concentrated tannins and intense acidity over the jammy fruits. Drink from 2018."
"Dominated by Merlot, this is big, ripe wine. It still has the youthful tannic structure, but it also has so much good berry fruitiness. Rich, juicy with acidity and fresh black currants, it will benefit from some aging. Drink from 2016."
"Strong spice and burnt wood aromas are followed by high toast flavors. The wine is solid, firm and at this stage just hinting at the ripe fruit underneath, meaning it needs time to open and broaden. Drink this wine with its excellent potential from 2017."
"Produced from old vines, this is a new-wood-aged, polished and ripe wine. With its juicy black fruits and dark tannins, it is destined for good aging. Spice and a rich texture are working together to broaden and ripen this wine further. Drink from 2017."
"Full of the ripe fruit and structure of the vintage, this Merlot-dominated wine has big, bold tannins, spice and a dark, firm structure. The jammy fruits are developing well, likely to result in a generous, full-bodied wine from 2017."
The 74 acres of Bel-Air have produced a firm while juicy wine packed with both tannins and ripe blackberry fruits. The structure and ripe Merlot combine easily and suggest good aging. Drink from 2017.
"Dominated by 80% Merlot, this ripe and firm wine is full of red berry fruits with a solid, dry core that comes from the fruit tannins. The tannins are still young, still solid, so the wine even with its fruitiness needs to age. Drink from 2016."
"From Château des Landes' old vines, this is a concentrated, solid wine. Dark tannins have dark chocolate and licorice flavors, with a structure that dominates the fruit and needs to soften. New wood aging was perhaps excessive, but give the wine time. Drink from 2017."
"Firmly tannic, this wine is solid, firm and traditional in its dry structure. Black currant fruitiness shows briefly before the tannins and dark extract take over. It's a tough wine at this stage and could well remain hard. Try drinking from 2017."
"Powered by considerable tannins, this Merlot-based wine is firm and concentrated. Its fruit shows intense black plum skin and berry flavors that push through the dark structure. It's a rich wine that needs time. Drink from 2018."
"All the richness of Merlot is apparent in this dense and concentrated wine. It has dark tannins, ripe blackberry fruitiness and a firm, dry structure. The tannins and acidity promise aging. Drink from 2016."
"Fruity while still solidly tannic, this is a ripe Merlot-dominated wine. It has a touch of bitterness, but the main flavors are of black currant, fresh berries and a strong line in acidity. Drink from 2017."
"This wine is maturing well, giving a firm, structure and some stalkiness. It's dry and will remain that way, showing some mineral texture as well as black currant flavors. The wine will be at its best in 2015."
"With barnyard aromas, this is a rustic wine. It does have some red fruit flavors and acidity but these are compromised by the earthy texture."
"Full in the mouth, this is a ripe wine, showing wood, dark plums and a firm layer of tannins. There is a good black-fruit feel, brought out by the wine's acidity. This is serious and worth aging. Drink from 2017."
"From a selection of vines, this is a powerful, complex wine that boasts ripe tannins, sweet acidity and a juicy black currant character. It has structure and density that certainly indicate aging, so keep the wine for at least five years."
"A solid, structured wine, showing the fine tannins of the vintage along with ripe berry fruits. It has weight, acidity, without pushing the alcohol forward, remaining in balance. Age this wine for 3-4 years."
"Rich and packed with ripe Merlot-based fruit, this is a solid wine, with a berry flavor and tannins. The delicious, juicy flavors speak to the ripe fruit that needs several years to fully mellow and integrate."
"This dense, tannic, complex wine has blackberry and bitter chocolate flavors, with a dark, firm structure. The dusty tannins give weight and richness. Age this for five years."
"While the wine has some richness, it is also firmly structured, with a minerally severity from its tight tannins. Under the surface, there is a fruity character that's dominated by a juicy black-currant flavor."
"This small estate has produced a rich, smooth 2010, showcasing a delicious, fruity style, with no hint on the palate of its high alcohol. Red and black fruits mingle easily and warmly, and the proportionate acids and tannins suggest potential. Keep for four years."
"Rich red fruits along with a stalky element give this wine weight and structure. It's on the dry side, with the fruit tannins and wood notes still dominant. Good acidity offers a bright aftertaste."
"Even though it is weighty, very full and dense, the wine has a fine balance, with acidity that cuts through the richness."
"This is a complex wine that shows sweet berry fruits, ripe tannins and new wood flavors. It is dense and chewy while also being full of rich fruits. This is a wine for aging, although its smooth character suggests it will age relatively quickly."
"It's the 100% Merlot that gives the alcohol and superripe fruit to this wine, redeemed by the acidity. Licorice and dark chocolate flavors go with the sweetest plums and spice. Age for 3-4 years."
"Consultant Hubert de Bouärd has given this wine a velvey texture as well as rich wood and spice flavors. The wine is generous, full bodied and dense with black fruits. The blend, with 90% Merlot, comes from one of the largest vineyards in Lussac. Drink this rich wine from 2020."
"This dense wine from the so-called Saint-Émilion satellite village of Lussac has plenty of the richness of the vintage as well as ripe berry fruits and generously integrated tannins. With plenty of black fruits at the end, the wine will age well. Drink from 2021."
"This wine is fruity but has a lean texture that emphasizes tannins rather than fruit. With a dry core and bitter-chocolate flavors, the wine misses out on the fruit."
"Plenty of attention seems to have been lavished on this wine produced from the best parcels on the estate. It offers dense tannins, new-wood mint flavors and an edge of extraction in the bitter-chocolate flavors. With time this will be a rich wine, but one balanced and based around fruit and tannins. Drink from 2023."
"Ripe Merlot makes its generous mark in this rich, fruity wine. It has structure and dense tannins as well as juicy black-currant fruits. The richness is not excessive, accompanying this core of tannins. Drink from 2023."
"Ripe and structured, this wood-aged wine is still developing. It has a dark structure, dense blackberry fruit and powerful concentration. A peppery touch of alcohol gives it a bitter finish, which should dissipate as it ages. Drink from 2022"
"Taking advantage of the very ripe grapes of 2003, Bernard Magrez's winemakers pulled all the richness out of the fruit and into this intensely sweet, dark wine, with its black plums and fig flavors. The wood is all around this fruit, dense and spicy."
"A rich, succulent wine, full of ripe black currant and spice flavors, wrapped around a core of dry tannins. This is a wine that needs time to develop, but with its toast and other wood flavors and its weighty fruit, it should show well in five years."
"Owned and produced by José Sanfins, who is the manager at neighboring classed growth Château Cantenac Brown, this wine balances the elegance of Margaux with the richness of the vintage, giving swathes of black-currant fruit that has been lifted by the new-wood aging. Drink this wine from 2023."
"Still showing plenty of wood aging, this wine is young.However, the ripe black-currant fruit and the structured tannins point to a good aging potential. From a single parcel planted in 1962, the wine has concentration and a rich character. Let it mature over several years and drink from 2023."
"This comes from a single parcel of vines planted in 1962. The old vines give extra concentration to the already rich wine. It also shows considerable high-toast wood-aging flavors that need to soften into the black-currant fruits. It is aromatic, with a core of tannins from the 70% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink this evolving wine from 2023."
"Produced mainly from younger vines at Château Kirwan, this is the estate's second wine. It is ripe with berry fruit, dense tannins and the potential of further aging. It is on the point of showing signs of maturity, as the fruit conveys mushroom as well as berry flavors. Drink from 2021."
"91-93 Barrel sample. There's beautiful fruit here: vibrant black plums and a touch of cinnamon. This has real Margaux elegance and character, with a fresh style, just supported by open tannins. Lascombes seems to be coming into its own at last."
The second wine of Château Margaux is certainly as good as many crus bourgeois. This vintage is ripe and elegant.  For fruit that is so ripe what is fascinating is the way the wine finishes with acidity and a great lift. Delicious in three to five years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates.
"Cantenac-Brown has been tending to classic Margaux delicacy in recent years, but this 2003 is an exception. It is round and full of ripe blackberry fruits, with good tannins and is likely to develop well. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Arsac has become the artistic center of the Médoc, rivaling Mouton-Rothschild's museum. Since buying Arsac in 1986, owner Philippe Rauox has achieved a big turnround in quality: this 2003 Cuvée Le Colombier, the top wine from the property, shows great dusty tannins, hearty fruit and considerable richness. Imported by Victoire Imports."
"Finally it looks as if Lascombes is back on form. With its huge vineyard, a good selection of the best fruit has been the issue, and this has happened with 2003. It's not a huge wine, but there is smooth, polished fruit, layered with wood and  dusty tannins. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This wine manages to combine some of the delicacy and elegance of Margaux with the richness of 2003. Under the direction of Claire Villars (also of Château Ferriére classed growth), there is a confidence in this estate and its vineyards which lie adjacent to Château Margaux. Great acidity and black fruits finish the ensemble."
"The most southern of the crus bourgeois estates in Margaux, the house at Siran is familiar to visitors from its pink exterior. This vintage is powerful, but still manages to exude that Margaux style and poise. There are dense tannins but they don't overwhelm, leaving fine black fruits to balance the dryness."
"With its usual high proportion of Merlot, Palmer 2003 was always going to be a generous, very ripe wine. And so it is proving, but what is so satisfying about the wine at this stage is that the great sweet fruit, which comes right out of the glass. Underneath, of course, there are tannins, so this wine could be drunk soon, and then aged for another 15 years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This is a great wine. The winemaking team, headed by chateau director John Kolasa, has taken advantage of the heat of 2003 and the fact that Rauzan-Ségla has a great vineyard. They have crafted a densely tannic wine that, at its heart, retains a cool elegance. There is great fruit, blackcurrants, and acidity which adds to the sense of poise with power. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This may be from the exceptional vintage of 2003, but Château Margaux remains true to form. First and foremost, it is a refined, elegant wine, with complex layers of flavors. But, yes, the hot summer is there the dense, dry tannins, but somehow they seem to float through the wine rather than sitting heavily in the middle. Acidity and freshness come to finish, giving the wine a delicious lift. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This chateau has a fine and deserved reputation, as this powerful but elegant 2003 shows. It has all the sophistication of Margaux, along with some lightness that balances the dry tannins. Imported by Vignobles De France."
"Brane-Cantenac's natural elegance, at the heart of Margaux, doesn't seem to have survived 2003 as well as some other properties, despite the initial favorable impression at barrel tasting time. That is to say that the fruit is very generous, juicy almost, but its ripeness seems out of proportion to the soft tannins and sweet aftertaste. Other current vintages, particularly 2001 and 2004, have been better. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Under the same ownership as Giscours, and benefiting from big investment in recent years, this is an estate at the top of its form. The wine has aromas of sweet, new wood, while the palate is packed with tarry fruits and spicy wood and herbs. Flavors of ripe black currants give a rich, satisfying feel. This is a wine that is well structured, dense and, given another five years, will be delicious."
"A great, rich wine from what owner Henri Lurton calls a classic year. There are huge, sweet tannins, solid black fruit flavors and ripeness, without losing sight of balance between richness, dryness and acidity. This is a wine that will age over many years."
"As with so many other wines from the 2001 vintage, this Palmer is classic Margaux. It has delicacy and elegance, but it also packs power, concentration and dark, dry flavors. Intense and concentrated, the richness of the high proportion of Merlot in Palmer's blend shows through, while the Cabernet Sauvignon gives a fresh lift at the end."
"Once the sole claim to fame of this estate was that it was the smallest, as well as one of the most obscure, of the classed growths. Now, its fame come from the quality of its wines. Winemaker Claire Villars-Lurton has crafted a wine that is dark and brooding, with big, powerful, intense fruit, dark flavors and solid tannins. Bordeaux in style, but has a great, polished, ripe feel too."
"A huge, powerful, dense wine, which layers pure black fruits over dusty tannins. This is an impressive wine, proof of Rauzan-Ségla's improvements since Chanel took over ownership. It is packed with fruits, like an intense jelly, but also has dryness, acidity and good aging potential."
"To call Kirwan a rising star is no longer true, since this property, owned by the Schyler family, and with Michel Rolland as consultant, is now firmly back in its right quality place among classed growths. It is modern in style, as is expected, but the dark, black currant, extracted fruits, new wood and structure don't detract from its elegance."
"It may have had a few winemaking controversies in recent years, but Giscours is now on a roll, under the ownership of Dutch businessman Eric Albada Jelgersma. How good it is, is shown in the 2001 wine, which is generous, almost opulent, rich and dense. Despite the richness, though, this is still Bordeaux: Dry tannins, tarry black-fruit flavors and firmness place the wine definitely at the table."
"""For me, this vintage is what makes Margaux special,"" says Margaux winemaker Paul Pontallier. He is right: With its denseness, spice, flavors of black currants layered with dryness and fresh acidity, this is a huge and impressive wine that never forgets that it is Margaux. It is still young, and the dry tannic aftertaste, which lasts for many minutes, shows this."
"A big rich, well-made wine that comes from Soussans in the north of Margaux appellation. It is solid, with some new wood flavors, black fruits and tarry tannins that leave a firm, dry aftertaste."
"A fresh, fruity wine, with cigar and wood aromas, spice and light black fruits. This wine comes from before the renaissance that is taking place at Lascombes, and shows the lightness of the wines produced under the old ownership. It is balanced and fresh, with a good, dry aftertaste."
"Angludet is the story of an estate that has been built up painstakingly over several decades. The Sichels, whose family home this is, make very satisfying wines, which are always good values. The 2001, with its good structure, its black fruits and its sympathetic use of wood, has balance and elegance. Ripe fruits with tobacco aromas complete the package."
"While the latter years of Lichine family ownership saw a decline in the quality of this estate, new owners have brought about a remarkable renaissance. This 2001 is rich and confident, with layers of wood that balance well with blackberry and currant jelly fruits. This is developing into a serious, impressive wine."
"The style of Cantenac-Brown is generally softer, richer than other Margaux, and this 2001 is no exception. It has a perfumed character, which has sweet, meaty flavors over ripe fruit. It has exotic spices, layered with dark wood and red fruits. To finish, there are dark tarry flavors and a blackberry-jelly freshness."
"Gonzague Lurton, current president of the Margaux producers, has invested considerably in pushing this estate forward. The wine has rich, open, generous fruit, with soft but firmly present tannins and juicy flavors. Combined with a subtle used of new wood, this shows well, and will develop well over many years."
"Under the same control as Château Ferriére, this wine reveals the same sense of power, style and elegance. It is polished, packed with ripe fruit and dense tannins. Tobacco and cedar aromas make this an immediately enticing wine that still offers great potential for aging."
"A quarter century of improvements have made their positive mark on the wines of Marquis de Terme, as revealed in this 2001. It is a generously opulent wine, with its richness and soft tannins, but the spice, the dryness and ripe acidity give it structure and balance. It has good aging potential, but, with its richness, could be drunk now."
"The 2001 is rich, dense, concentrated, with dusty tannins and solid black fruits. The palate is rich and spicy, with new wood flavors supporting firm, ripe fruit. The wine is still young, with dry fruit tannins and a layer of acidity, and excellent potential."
"One of the stars of Margaux, Monbrison 2001 is packed with rich, powerful black fruits, with open, generous fruit flavors and great new-wood flavors. This is an impressive, modern wine, powered with dense fruit, as well as some elegance and style."
"The moated castle of Issan belongs to the Cruse family, one of Bordeaux's most famous. Under the direction of Emmanuel Cruse, and with consultant Jacques Boissenot, the estate is enjoying something of a renaissance. With its great, generous, rich and sweet fruit, its ripe tannins and its black jelly flavors, it makes a powerful statement. Wood is there, but doesn't dominate. The wine will develop over the next 5-10 years."
"Huge investment is paying off at Labegorce. And it has not resulted in a wine that is simply modern in style. For here the new wood is well integrated, the fruit is structured, and never too extracted, and the ripeness also has layers of Bordeaux dryness."
"One of the many Margaux estates under the control of the Lurton family, this is a classic wine, with dry wood and dark tannins, flavors of black currants and light acidity. There is no mistaking this as Bordeaux, with its serious, ageworthy fruits and tannins."
"This wine has pleasant, fresh fruit, some good tannins and ripe fruit. It is soft, with forward fruits, and a simplicity that makes it ready to drink now."
"A well-flavored, well-structured wine, which emphasizes Margaux elegance. Flavors of black currant, Mediterranean herbs and spices are all harmonious. It may not be a big wine, but it has richness, light tannins and good intensity."
"Mature already, displaying leather, earth and tobacco nuances on the nose, followed by flavors of black cherry and tobacco. Light-bodied, with a juicy, mouthwatering finish. Drink over the next 2-3 years."
"A well-made, fresh, fruity wine, straightforward but ready to drink. Light, forward fruits and sweet spice layer over dusty, woody tannins. The wine is ripe and developing well."
"This is traditional winemaking, but done well. It is a pleasant, easy wine, one that shows good structure. Ready to drink, but should develop over 5 years."
"A soft, ready-to-drink Margaux, with scents of damp clay and leather followed by black cherry and vanilla flavors. Boasts a plesant creaminess on the palate and complicating hints of leather and earth on the finish."
"Spicy, foresty aromas dominate what subdued fruit there is. The palate is tight and grippy, with full-on tannins that really get after your cheeks. Amid those tannins is some grapey fruit and a bit of toastiness."
"This is a big, powerful, firm wine, with a top layer of ripe, glamorous fruit flavors. Blackcurrant jelly fruits are shot through with ripe acidity and soft tannins. It should develop relatively fast, but then last well."
"Under new ownership, Prieuré-Lichine continues its rapid quality improvement. The wine is concentrated, with dark tannins and brooding fruit, dominated by new wood. It is rich, but also structured for a steady development over 10-15 years."
"A hugely concentrated wine showing chewy, but ripe tannins. Smooth, polished fruit combines with well-balanced wood and suppressed power. This is certainly a wine that will develop well, making it drinkable in five years and mature in 10-15 years."
"Thanks to the total dedication of owner Jean-Luc Vonderheyden, Monbrison continued to perform outside its class in 2000. Fragrant, perfumed aromas with suggestions of vanilla and lavender make this wine immediately attractive. It is soft, which suggests its aging will be fast, but the liquorice fruit flavors and ripeness will give pleasure after five years."
"If Margaux is the most delicate of the Médoc wines, then this is the epitome of Margaux. It is light, poised and attractively perfumed. The fruit is elegant and fresh with a fine streak of acidity."
"The renaissance of Kirwan, with the consultancy of Michel Rolland, continues with this ripe, forward, concentrated wine. The tannins are sweet and soft, with a solid, chunky structure that promises a long life. The finish displays balanced new wood flavors and a smooth polish."
"At this stage, this is very closed, very tight, giving little. But it is possible to discern that this is going to be a beautiful wine. There are flavors of sweet raisins and the fruit has a new world richness, but the structure of dry tannins is always present. It looks as though it has a good, long life."
"At first taste, this wine seems more new world than Bordeaux. But then the subtle, perfumed aromas and structured fruit show through, along with the clean acidity and black tannic fruits. Give this wine at least 12 years before opening."
"Animal and bell pepper aromas mask a soft, relatively lightweight wine, which has fine acidity and fresh red fruit flavors."
"Attractive, fresh flavors with ripe, red fruits make this wine very forward and immediate. It does lack some concentration, but the ripe fruit and delicate perfumes will make it beautifully drinkable in five years."
"This is not as big or as concentrated as many 2000s. But it has elegance and style, along with fine, ripe perfumed fruit and attractive, balancing acidity. Give this wine at least 8 years before drinking."
"A solid, chunky structure is the hallmark of this big wine. The fruit is black, full of dark tannins. Perhaps it lacks subtlety, but that is replaced with great power and potential."
"The second wine from the biodynamic estate of Durfort-Vivens, this is a deliciously ripe fruity wine, dominated by 82% Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a crisp accessible character that will allow it to age relatively quickly. The wine has juicy acidity, red-berry fruits and final acidity. Drink from 2019."
"Black fruits dominate this second wine of Kirwan, an 1855 Third Growth Grand Cru Classé. The oak aging is subtle and gives a smooth character rather than strong toasty flavors. The richness and structure do promise some aging although this wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2020."
"There is a sense of pure juicy black-currant fruit that shoots through this great wine. With tannins that are firm while not a jot too much, the wine is crisp, packed with fruit and set for many years of aging. It is beautiful, fruity and intensely structured. Drink from 2027."
"It's easy to call this a beautiful wine-it's dense and lush, with great layers of black fruit and acidity. The first fully biodynamic vintage from this estate has certainly yielded impressive ripe fruit, with structured tannins and dark berry flavors that linger long. It has enormous potential, certainly not be ready to drink before 2027."
Layers of black fruits and tight tannins set this wine on a serious road. It has the freshness of the vintage as well as the bright acidity. At the same time it is structured and dense. This second wine of Château Margaux is ripe and ethereal in its lift. Drink from 2024.
"Owned by art collector Philippe Raoux, who has filled the park of the chateau with impressive sculptures, this estate produces serious and complex wines. This latest release continues in that tradition. It is rich, structured and full of swathes of black fruit. The wine will take time, so wait until 2021."
"The small 11-acre estate is situated at the northern end of the Margaux appellation. This wine, with its high percentage (70%) of Merlot is richly fruity with generous tannins and brilliant, ripe blackberry flavors. It has just the right amount of structure to allow it to age. Drink from 2021."
"92-94. Barrel Sample. This estate vineyard is full of modern sculptures that are collected by the owner. The wine shows fine, smooth tannins and a dark texture that gives it great long-term potential. It is a beautifully made wine: firm where it needs to be and with fine fruitiness. It will be ready in 2027."
"In the village of Soussans, and in the north of the Margaux appellation, this estate has a fine reputation for its wines. This vintage, with its great balance between fruit and tannins, shows why. It is a ripe wine full of black fruit and with the bright acidity of the vintage. Drink the wine from 2021."
"This is a small property under the same ownership as Château du Cartillon in the Haut-Médoc. The wine is ripe, juicy and with delicious blackberry fruits. It has a dark core of tannins ready to push the wine forward as it ages. It will certainly need time, so wait until 2021."
"While the wine from this major estate is dry at this stage, it is just covering for the juicy black-currant fruit. It is a finely crafted wine, firm and structured while preserving the great fruit of the vintage. With this balance, the wine will develop well. Drink from 2024."
"This is a complete wine, full of both tannins and great swathes of ripe fruit. It has a serious side as well in its solid structure and concentration. The juicy blackberry fruits are beginning to calm down and meld into a fine dense wine that will age very well. Drink from 2025."
"Still dry and concentrated and with swathes of rich tannins, the wine is dark and dense. The undertow of ripe black fruit is impressive. It obviously has considerable aging potential, Drink this serious wine from 2025."
"This is a full-bodied wine, from one of the leading estates in Margaux. It is ripe with juicy blackberry and black-currant fruits. This fruit contrasts with the dark tannins and powerful structure. It is going to develop slowly and impressively to be ready to drink from 2025."
"This comes from one of the small Margaux vineyards that are dotted amongst the big-name estates. René Renon's wine is ripe and juicy-still young and exuberant. It balances Merlot and Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc in almost equal proportions, giving a wine that has structure and plenty of berry fruits. Drink this wine from 2020."
"One of the largest estates in Margaux, Lascombes is now performing well. With this vintage the heavy over-oaking of past years has gone to be replaced with a wine that is full of black fruits as much as rich tannins. There is concentration and a good potential for aging. Drink from 2025."
Siran is in the south of the Margaux appellation just where the gravel outcrops rise above the river. It shows its fine position in this tannic wine. It has all the black-currant fruit buried for the moment under the structure. It is a serious wine that will repay aging. Drink from 2022.
This is a wine that brings out all the bright fruit of the vintage. It has classic black-currant flavors and crisp acidity. The tannins are a firm supporting act to this wine that will develop well over the medium term.
"This 23-acre-estate is situated in the south of the Margaux appellation, close to classed growth Château Giscours. While not classified, it still has the ability to produce a fine ripe wine that also has great structure. Acidity and firm tannins are very present along with concentrated blackberry fruits. Drink this fine wine from 2019."
"This second wine of Labégorce Margaux is named after the former neighboring estate Labégorce Zédé that was amalgamated after the 2009 vintage. This is a ripe wine, full of the fruit of the vintage as well as having a firm dry tannic structure that will allow it to age. With juicy blackberry fruits still so youthful, it is going to be ready drink from 2019."
"A dense wine that is showing signs of heavy extraction, with dark chocolate and bitter flavors. In a vintage with crisp fruitiness being the defining factor, it is a bit of a shame. The dark edge needs to mellow before the wine can balance out."
"Strong wood aging and toasty flavors dominate this wine. They give a hard extracted edge which takes away from the black-currant fruitiness. While this will soften, the fruit in this vintage should have been allowed more expression. Drink the wine from 2020."
"The second wine of classed growth Rauzan-Gassies in Margaux is ripe, soft with touches of licorice, wood aging and spice. It has attractive, forward red-berry flavors and the tannins of the 65% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. It is ready to drink."
"Crisp fruit dominates this second wine from Durfort Vivens. It has tannins, tight acidity as well as the potential for further aging. Spice and wood flavors finish the wine on a firm note. Drink from 2018."
"This is the second wine of Labégorce, named as a remembrance of the separate Château Labégorce-Zédé that was purchased in 2005. It is a firm wine, with a perfumed character from the judicious wood aging. The tannins are likely to remain part of the character of this wine, working with the black-currant fruit and the final, smoky flavor. Drink from 2017."
"The second wine of Château Kirwan, this has something of the same stylishness as the top wine. It certainly has structure and layers of red fruits along with acidity. Produced from young vines, it is up-front with its juicy fruitiness and fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
"This wine is smooth, ripe with fine tannins and red plum and black-currant fruits that are soft and gentle. Acidity dominates at this stage, supported by the tannins. It brings out the fruit and freshness of the year while also keeping some structure from the high percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink from 2025."
"Vines surround a garden full of contemporary sculpture in the grounds of the Château. This wine, produced at the western end of the Margaux appellation, is well structured with firm tannins that are balanced by juicy berry fruits and acidity. It is well integrated, on the way to aging well. Drink from 2018."
"Made in a firm, solid style, this wine shows considerable potential. Pure berry flavors are prominent along with the dense tannins. It is a good wine for the difficult vintage and will be ready to drink from 2020. The estate is in the process of converting to biodynamic methods."
"This well-made, ripe wine has a good balance between its fresh black currant fruits and tannins that are already softening. It is a success for the vintage, emphasizing fruit and fresh acidity, and will likely be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018."
This wine is full of bright fruit and attractive acidity. It's been made to take advantage of the fruitiness of the year and is likely to develop quickly. Drink from 2018.

"This fresh, ripe wine has plenty of juicy black-currant flavor. It is crisp, strengthened by tannins and with a great burst of acidity. It needs to calm down and round out before it will be ready to drink. Wait until 2018."
This wine is solid and dense with probably too much extracted tannins. There are only hints of fruitiness. It will soften although it's likely to remain stalky. This is the first vintage in which some of the vineyard was managed organically.
"This wine has attractive black-currant fruits and fresh, light acidity. It's an early-developing wine with soft tannins and a stalky backdrop. Drink from 2018."
"This wine is toasty and spicy with black-currant fruits that are still developing. It is fresh although its firm structure needs time to soften. As it matures, it will develop a balance between fruit and tannins. Drink from 2018."
"Perfumed wood dominates this wine, giving it structure and tannins. Juicy red fruits are still submerged beneath this welter of dryness. The wine needs time to integrate. Drink from 2019."
This wine has an austere character that comes from the tight structure. There are only hints of possible fruit. It is likely to remain severe even as it matures.
"This second wine of Château Durfort-Vivens is ripe, firm and well structured. Beautiful ripe black currant and berry fruits are cut with intense acidity. From the great 2010 vintage, it is solid, dense and full of fruitiness as well as tannins. It still does need to age, so drink from 2017."
"Very structured and dark, this is a wine for the long haul. It is concentrated and balanced, still very young and only just hinting at the black fruits that show the rich potential of this wine. Drink from 2020."
"Ripe and rich, this has plenty of the stylishness of Margaux while also having a structured core. The full-bodied fruit offers black plum and berry flavors, paced with firm tannins and a dark, intense aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
"Initially, Mongravey often seems to use too much wood. With this 2012, although there are big wood tannins, the fruit is up to the challenge. The result is a rich wine that has weight, black berry fruits and a dark core. It needs to age; wait until 2018."
"Like many wines from Marie-Laure Lurton, this is dry and shows its firm tannic and wood character. Here the wood verges on too much, giving an austere, hard character. However, the black currant fruit will come through, giving a dry wine that will have some richness. Drink from 2018."
"A small vineyard of just over 10 acres in the north of the Margaux appellation, Bellevue de Tayac obviously received serious attention from then-owner Jean-Luc Thunevin of Château Valandraud in Saint-Émilion. You can taste that in the vanilla flavors from the wood aging and the smooth texture. It's a micro-Cuvée that shows great richness and potential. Drink from 2018."
"Made up of several different parcels scattered across the Margaux appellation, the Château now has 24 acres. This 2012 is structured while also full of ripe fruit. The tannins lie behind the juicy red fruitiness and the immediately attractive ripe flavors. It should age, but not for long. Drink from 2017."
This structured wine has firm tannins and a solid core of wood-aging flavors. At the same time it shows some of the style of Margaux with its balanced acidity and ripe berry fruits. Age until at least 2018.
"Heavy wood aromas lead to a wine that's dominated by burnt wood with only subdued fruit. It's packed with tannins that are tough and extracted, giving a bitter coffee flavor. Although it will soften, the wine will likely keep its dry, tough character."
"This is the second wine of Château Labégorce. It has much of the elegance of the top wine with firm tannins and generous fruits kept in stylish proportion. Black currant and berry fruits lie under the dark, dry exterior. The wine is dense, needing several years' aging. Drink from 2018."
"This second wine of Château Labegorce is a more gentle mirror to the estate wine. It has a fine use of wood, along with juicy ripe red fruits and tannins that fit well into the rounded texture. It will be ready to drink from 2016."
"A serious and concentrated wine that is one of the stars of the vintage. With its tight tannins and a considerable sense of structure, it shows a dark and dense side. It's full in the mouth, black plum skins and intense acidity giving a lilt of freshness at the end. Drink from 2019."
"A solidly structured wine, it is both elegant and intensely powerful. It is disclosing its fruitiness slowly, at the moment dense and concentrated. A restrained edge provides complexity and balance. It will need aging, so don't drink before 2022."

"This is typical of the ripe and opulent style of this property with superripe black currant fruit. It's concentrated in flavor, but also structured with smooth tannins. It's a wine both for short-term fruitiness and long-term power and density. Drink from 2017."
"Cantenac Brown is on a roll now, and even in lesser vintages. This is a full, ripe wine packed with black currant flavor, but also structured with solid tannins. With a juicy acidity on the finish, and boosted by its dry core, it's certain to age well. Drink from 2018."
"Power and ripeness walk hand-in-hand with this major player. The wine is opulent and extracted with flavors of rich blackberry fruits, but shows a firmness in tannins and dense texture. Drink from 2018 and it's sure to be a great success."

"93-95. Barrel sample. This firm, dry wine is solidly rich and full in the mouth. With fine acidity and black currant fruit that show through the tannins, it is a wine with considerable potential."
"Dauzac, whose vineyards are in the south of Margaux, has produced a severe wine in 2010, full of impressive tannins. It is not without charm, however, and it will certainly fill out its serious structure over the next several years. Give this dense wine time."
"A ripe, juicy and forward wine, this is all fruit-but it's delicious fruit. The tannins are restrained behind the exuberant fruitiness. It may not be classic Bordeaux, but it is likely to be very drinkable in 2-3 years."
"This Margaux is full of firm tannins that parallel the fragrant blackberry and black plum touches. It has a dense structure, very much in line with the year, while the finish is juicy and fruity."
"Grapes from 40-year-old vines make up the bulk of this wine, giving it structure, concentration and weight. Densely wrought, its black fruit is still suppressed by wood and fruit tannins. The balance will come, giving an elegant wine in 3-4 years."
"A softly textured wine, this has richness coming from black and red berry fruits. Wood and juiciness combine well in this attractive wine that will be ready to drink in a few months."
"While it has weight and richness, this is also seriously structured, a wine packed with dry tannins. The potential is all there-the sweet fruit of the vintage along with a solid texture and final acidity."
"Firmly structured, dark-fruited wine, very solid and dense. It has weight along with black currant fruits and acidity. It's a wine that is rich but seriously structured for aging."
"A wine that continues the impressive rise of du Tertre. It is becoming one of the sure values of Margaux, and this 2009 is both ripe and finely balanced. The acidity boosts the rich fruits, sweet tannins and the warm finish."
"Warm and rounded, this spicy wine has wood flavors just showing through the ripe fruit. It is already delicious, with rich blackberry flavors right up front, although its aging potential is evident with the concentrated, deep structure."
"Dark and structured, this is a firm wine. It has a smoky wood character, powerful tannins over intensely ripe fruit. Acidity and sweetness balance to give a dense wine, powered with richness and destined to age for many years."
"A rich and opulent wine, very ripe, packed with luscious blackberry and damson fruit as well as sweet tannins. It is a fruit salad of fruit flavors given structure by a core of dryness. Already a gorgeous wine, but one that will also age."
"A beautiful wine, with the firmest tannins surrounded by perfumed fruit. It is dense, of course, but this density is balanced with great elegance, blackberry fruits, sweetness and final juicy acidity. The wine is structured, a powerhouse of concentration while preserving this complete style."
"A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured."
"This is a delicate wine with a very Margaux feel. The delicious red berry fruits and light layers of tannin are in balance, suggesting a wine that will age relatively quickly, and is already drinkable now."
"A solid effort, with attractive, balanced black currant fruits and ripe acidity. The wine layers fruit and integrated tannins. It feels chunky and dense, finishing dry."
"Soft and ripe wine that shows the richness of the year while offering a core of tannins. It is immediately attractive, although the structure and final tannins do promise aging potential."
"A densely tannic wine that is showing fine aging potential. It is well endowed with weight, acidity and ripe black currant fruits. With the rich fruit that opens slowly in the mouth, it has a fine combination of sweetness and structure. Age for 5-6 years."
"A wood- and fruit-driven wine, very modern in style. It has the ripest fruit along with dense tannins and concentration. The style is more international than Margaux, but the wine is certainly delicious."
"On the lean side, with a layered concentrated wood structure. The wine has weight along with dryness, although the fruit is harder to discern."
"The wine has weight, is warm and spicy, with bold fruit flavors. A fine wine from Angludet, it is ripe, the wood judiciously balanced, finishing with tight acidity."
"A wine with potential. The elements are all there: red berry fruits, a firm line of ripe tannins and the acidity to go with them. It needs at least four years before they come together into a structured whole."
"A fresh wine, with some of the richness of the vintage showing in up-front red berry fruits. The tannins are already well integrated, allowing the wine to show a softer side. It is for medium-term aging."
"Dense, attractive, sweet, wood-laden wine, with ripe black berry fruits and important fruit tannins. The wine is concentrated, firm, based on great fruit and structure."
"From one of the properties controlled by Marie-Laure Lurton, this is a finely made wine. It revels in its structure, while around that there are ripe, soft red berry fruits, spice and an intensely juicy acidity. Full of charm, ready to age."
"From the north of the Margaux appellation, this is a wine that has tense, acidic, black berry fruits, soft tannins and a light, juicy character. Not for long-term aging."
"A wine that offers plenty of the charm of Margaux, with its soft tannins, layers of chocolate, smooth texture and juicy fruit. The wood at this stage is prominent, and needs to settle down."
"Big, rich, almost velvet in texture, this is a powerful wine. It has spice, black berry fruits, layers of wood and black plum skins. Powerful wine for long-term aging and medium-term accessibility."
"A dense wine, powerful while also elegant. It shows all the best character of a grand Margaux, with fine tannins as well as dense structure. It will age well."
"Potentially an aromatic wine that will develop a rich, velvety character. At this young stage, the fruit is dominated by firm tannins that sit at the heart of the wine. It has all the density for a good development, aging over 5-10 years."
"The heavy bottle, as so often, is the giveaway: This is meant as an important statement. The wine comes from a small parcel of vines owned by Cambon la Pelouse in Margaux. It has 100% new wood, but the richness of the fruit balances, giving a smooth, rich wine with black berry, bitter chocolate and mint flavors."
A densely firm wine with fine perfumed fruit. The fruit and acidity ride well with the firm tannins and the restrained wood element. It is well balanced and likely to age for several years.
"While not strictly part of the Haut-Médoc Château Cambon la Pelouse, this small parcel in Margaux is under the same ownership and vinification. The wine has weight, some solid fruit, with the wood adding polish but not dominating. A well-structured wine for medium-term aging."
"Very modern and polished in style, this wine goes for the soft, juicy fruit characters. The tannins are sweet, equally soft, already delicious in character, finishing with smoky cranberry and black currant flavors."
"This is a solid, finely perfumed wine, the tannins giving concentration and structure. There is some severity as well, a sign that it is still settling into the bottle. But with its bitter chocolate character and tight texture, it should age well."
"The wood that dominated during the futures tastings in 2008 has calmed down, merging more easily into the rich fruits. There is an attractive smoky character, focused berry flavors and delicious spice. It should age well over 3-5 years."
"A wine with plenty of weight, fruit and balanced tannins. It shows a smoky character from the toasty wood, followed by broad berry fruits and sweetness. The ripe fruit flows naturally from the tannins, both offering aging potential."
"This is a solid effort, impressively powerful, the tannins and extract just right for the fruit. The flavors are juicy, but the backbone is right there, the aftertaste dark and dense. Certainly likely to age."
"Firm, solid, chunky, a great success from a Château that is currently in top form, even in more difficult years. The bright fruits charge through the tannins, giving some richness, balancing with the elegance and freshness of the year. Worth aging."
"Silky wine, fresh and light, balanced with high acidity cutting through black berry fruits. The structure has some substance, but this is a light, aromatic wine, developing fast, already delicious, and only for medium-term aging."
"A soft juicy wine, with mid-weight. The berry fruits, the black currant juice and the fresh acidity are enjoyable. It's developing fast, and not likely to age."
"As sometimes with Angludet, there is a rusticity to the tannins that brings down the fruit. The freshness, though, is there, an attractive bright berry character, spiced with cinnamon."
"With its high wood flavors and aromas of mint, this sets out to be a modern, extracted style of wine. But it has the lightness of Margaux in 2007, the Cabernet tannins soft and open. It already has good balance, suggesting it is not for long aging."
"A wine that emphasizes the fruity character of the year, putting aside any missing tannins. Wood still dominates the fruit, giving spice and bitter chocolate flavors, but the green edge present in the futures tasting has gone, to give final cranberry and black currant freshness."
"A wine that has richness, with acidity, layers of spice and black currant fruit flavors. The dominant cassis gives elegance, and already a forward balance of fruit and wood."
"Big, rounded wine that brings together ripe fruits and taut tannins. It is solid, chunky, spiced and balanced. Black fruits finish an impressive wine for the vintage."
"This is a disappointment. The wine is tart, stalky and, at the same time, light. It has an edge of green that suggests underripe fruit. Developing fast."
"Tight and tannic, this is a wine with as much structure as fruit. It has a dusty, austere quality, the fruit a light layer underneath. The high proportion of Petit Verdot in the blend gives color as well as those tannins."
"Now that this estate has calmed down in its wood aging, it is possible to see the beautiful fruit that is grown here. This wine is structured, firm with tannins and some spice from the wood, while allowing plenty of black-currant fruit to shine through. This ripe wine needs several years to develop. Drink from 2024"
"Predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine shows a wonderful black-currant purity on the palate, along with intense, vibrant acidity. The background is all tannin, which speaks to its aging potential. This wine is the last vintage produced by Paul Pontallier, who was general manager from 1990 until his death in 2016. It's a memorable wine and one for aging. Drink from 2027."
"Owner Philippe Raoux has created both a major sculpture park and a series of impressive vintages at this estate at the western end of Margaux. This vintage is one of the best yet, rich and vibrant with great fruits and solid tannins. It needs serious aging, so drink from 2025."
"This dense and impressively ripe wine comes from a Sorge family estate in the northern part of the Margaux appellation. With black fruits and generous tannins, it is a big wine with considerable richness. This complex wine will age. Drink from 2025."
"This 11-acre property, centered on an ultramodern winery, is the most northerly estate in Margaux. The wine, with its blend of dense tannins and juicy black-currant fruit, is rich, with impressive concentration and minerality. With weight and a firm core, the wine will age well. Drink from 2025."
"The small vineyard in Soussans in the northern part of the Margaux appellation has produced this richly structured wine. Dark tannins and layers of wood aging are accompanied by black-currant fruits as well as dark-chocolate flavor. This wine needs to age, and will be best from 2023."
"This ripe, impressively textured wine is going to be rich and generous. Not just yet, because the tannins need to soften and integrate. That said, the blackberry fruits are juicy, with balanced acidity and a full texture. Drink this wine from 2022."
"This wine from an 11-acre property is soft and ripe, with plenty of ripe berry fruits. Hints of the 18 months in wood are still there although they are not at all obtrusive. It is an easy wine just touched by spice, and will be ready to drink by 2018."
"There is a tough, tannic core to this otherwise ripe and fruity wine. All to the good, as this will allow the bold, ripe wine to age well. Black-currant fruits are already showing their hand and will intensify, bringing in richness and a dense texture. Drink this wine from 2025."
"This rich wine is full of fruit and structured with layers of tannin. It's also stylish and elegant, with a suave texture that is already attractive. Black fruits mix with the structure to give a wine that will age well. Drink from 2026."
"Structure is the watchword for this wine. With dark tannins and concentration, it obviously has long-term potential. At the same time, the black-currant fruits are ripe and full bodied, giving rich contrast to the tannins. These two elements will allow this wine to age. It will be ready to drink from 2025."
"This is a powerful wine, with wood aging that adds richness to the dense tannins. Some tough extraction has not detracted from the ripe fruit or structure and will go as the wine matures. It should be ready to drink from 2026."
"Showing the richness of the vintage behind firm tannins, this wine is tough and solid at the moment although that will change as it matures. The hint of bitter over-extraction is the sole blemish on a wine that otherwise highlights the many improvements at this estate. Drink from 2025."
This structured wine comes from the Sichel family-owned estate. It has tannins and a dry character although this dry core is balanced with ripe black currants. Structure and fruit make this a good wine for medium-term aging. Drink from 2023.
"This is a ripe, juicy wine, showing the improvements at this potentially fine estate. Dense tannins and succulent fruit come together to give a wine that is both structured and complex. The black-currant and berry flavors are underlined with a ripe structure. Drink from 2024."
"From one of the most southerly of the Margaux vineyards, this attractively fruity wine is bright with black-currant flavors. Delicious acidity and layers of spice from wood aging promise a fine, ripe future."
"This is a perfumed wine, rich in black currants and acidity as well as firm tannins. It is concentrated and dense while also elegant. The aftertaste boosts the ripe fruit and balanced acidity. Drink from 2025."
"Owned by Henri Lurton, one of several Lurtons to own property in Margaux, this estate is performing in high gear. Its second wine is rich and concentrated with solid tannins as well as generous blackberry fruits. It will be impressive as it ages. Drink from 2020."
"Piled high with new wood, dark-chocolate flavors and dryness, this wine will be a tough call for many years. It will show better, although the over-indulgent use of wood will likely always keep it dry."
"Linked by ownership to another Margaux estate, Tour de Mons, this wine reflects the ripe fruit of the vintage. Its tannins are still firm although they are well balanced by the bright black-currant fruit. This generous wine will be ready to drink from 2019."
"Produced from a small acre of land in Margaux, this is made in the same extravagant style as the cult wines of Saint-Emilion. With 100% new wood, it is definitely modern in style, but there is sufficient concentration in the fruit to balance all that vanilla. It misses the 2006 freshness,but everything else is there."
"This intriguing wine is dominated by the 60% of normally rare Petit Verdot. Made by the same team as Château Paloumey, this wine shows an impressive color, and a rich, black berry juicy character. The tannins are solid, but the exuberant fruit overrides everything else."
"This wine brings out the soft side of Margaux with its easy and friendly fruits. Although there are definite tannins, they are well below the surface of the red berries and fresh acidity. Ready to drink now."
"A wine that tries too hard. The extract is strong, giving some bitterness. And, although the berry fruits are sweet and rich, the tannins edge the fruit with hardness. On the finish, some smokiness enhances the black currant juice, but that astringency just won't go away."
"New wood, sweet fruit, blackberry and plum skin flavors are all here in this round, ripe wine, with its soft, dusty tannins and delicious fresh acidity. This property has certainly joined the big league in Margaux."
"The fruit has become the main attraction here-layers of ripeness, tempered with an elegant smoothness. The tannins are certainly present in this powerful wine, but they are here to lend support, not dominate. With herbs and very clean black fruits, this is a wine to follow."
"This chateau gets better and better. The wine has power, but it is harnessed by the intense fruits, the blackberry flavors, the density and the wood. With the power, though, comes elegance, resulting in a wine that is ready to develop over many years."
"A powerfully ripe wine, with pure black currant flavors over soft, polished tannins. The wood balance is exemplary, offering just the right lift. Touches of cinnamon and vanilla give an extra dimension."
"Dense, rich and still young , this wine has excellent potential. Firmly structured and full of blackberry fruits, it comes from the small village of By in the northern Médoc. It likely will ready from 2021."
"This bottling forms part of a range of five wines produced by the Lafite-Rothschild winemaking team. Made from grapes grown in the northern Médoc, it is ripe and full of black fruits and rich tannins. Drink this wine from late 2019."
"Vineyards in the northern Médoc have produced a wine that while offering some attractive black-currant fruit also has an excess of wood flavors. At this stage, the fruit should be more prominent and the wine possibly will remain toasty and woody."
"A blend of equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this fresh, open wine is made to drink young. The red-fruit flavors, soft tannins and layer of ripe acidity are balanced and integrated. The wine is ready now."
"Still showing its wood aging, this wine is packed with black-currant fruits, firm tannins as well as layers of acidity and fruitiness. The high proportion of Merlot gives the wine a delicious juicy character that will develop further as it ages. Drink from 2022."
"Still surprisingly dominated by its wood aging, this is a rich, spicy wine. Black-currant fruits and juicy acidity need more time to develop and balance out the wood. Drink from 2020."
"This wine is a selection from the Castera estate. The high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon gives it black-currant fruits and fine tannins. Rich and still young, the wine will age well and should be drunk from 2022."
"Managed by Jean-Hubert Delon of Léoville Las Cases, this is without equal in the Medoc appellation. It shows breeding, depth of flavor, beautifully crafted tannins and fine, rich fruit without the overripeness so characteristic of 2003. With its structure, acidity and delicious fruit, this will age as well as any wine from a more classy appellation."
"The second wine of Château Potensac, and under the same ownership as Château Léoville Las Cases, this is an impressive wine in its own right, packed with very ripe fruit, but still preserving the outline and structure of a solid Médoc. There is a wood element, but it is mainly the luscious black fruit that stands out in this wine. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"The Mau family, who also run négociants Yvon Mau, have poured money into this Médoc chateau, bringing it back to life. It has paid off in this powerful, rich 2003, which packs blackberry flavors alongside new wood, polished tannins and  impressive aging potential. Imported by Victoire Imports."
"A soft wine that has easy but attractively ripe fruit. This is not a wine for aging, but in 2003, the estate has made a very drinkable wine. Patache stands for an ancient coaching inn, recollected on the wine's label by a coach and horses. Imported by Grands Chais de France."
"A small, 17-acre property near Saint-Laurent in the north of Medoc, this is a classic Bordeaux, with its tight tannins, layers of dryness and acidity. But these are not negatives because this is a delicious food wine, one that also has great black fruits. Imported by Victoire Imports."

"A fine effort from this reliable cru bourgeois, the 2002 Rollan de By boasts hints of toast and vanilla in its bouquet, but mostly offers up solid cassis fruit, with just a whiff of dried herbs. A velvety, supple texture and lush tannins suggest early drinkability. Try now-2010."
"Quite minty and herbal, but balanced somewhat by cherry, blackberry and vanilla flavors. A medium-weight quaffer with a fresh, cinnamon note to the finish."
"A usually reliable performer, Patache d'Aux produced a solid wine in the difficult 2002 vintage. A whiff of mint carries through on the palate, which blends herbs, berries and vanilla in a straightforward claret. Fruit shows through the firm tannins on the finish, suggesting this will improve over the next few years. Drink 2008-2012."
"From the great 2000 vintage, this is suitably deep, impressive wine. Wood and vanilla aromas show through to taste with sweet blackcurrants, some sweet jelly flavors, balanced with a big, long-term aging structure. Magnol is a property in the southern Médoc, owned by Barton & Guestier."
"Starts off with an herbal note that carries throughout. Blackberry, cassis, tar, spice and citrus flavors are in evidence as well. Tannins are a bit rustic. Kosher"
"Earthy, with little fruit. The flavors are thin and much like strawberry infused tea. Acidic and dry. Barely acceptable."
"Built along traditional lines, this claret features soft plummy Merlot fruit accented by leafy tobacco and cassis. Its cedary leanness makes it an ideal foil for rich meat dishes."
"Sound but a little thin in the middle, with drying tannins. A touch too much sweet oak for the light fruit. The red-fruit core holds together fairly well, and the finish is strong and solid. Time probably isn't on its side. Drink now with food for a pleasant experience."
"This estate, belonging to the Compagnet family, is in the northern Médoc. Some firm tannins are contrasted with the attractive acidity and berry fruits to create a warm spicy wine. Almost equal amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot give a balanced wine. Drink from 2018."
"The wine has ripe fruit, tannins that have now softened and signs of maturity. It is still juicy with attractive acidity as well as a touch of spice. Finely balanced, the wine from this Cru Bourgeois estate is elegant and ready to drink."
"The wine comes from a selection of parcels on the Castera estate. With a majority (60%) of Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine is structured and firm and still developing. It has red-berry and black-currant fruit along with plenty of tannic structure. Drink the wine from 2020."
"Although this youthful wine has obviously been in plenty of wood, it has the weight to reveal a promising future. So while the spice and toastiness are present now, they will soon integrate with the fine tannins and blackberry fruits. Drink this from 2019."
"From one of the estates owned by the Pagés family in the northern Médoc, the wine is spicy and rich with tannins and blackberry fruit. As a contrast, it is shot through with attractive acidity that is a character of the year. The wine will be ready to drink from 2019."
"The wine is rich and packed with ripe black fruits. The firm tannins are comfortably cushioned by the ripe texture. This is young, although developing well. Drink this wine, with its fine potential, from 2019."
"Low yields and a high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon have produced an impressive, dense and structured wine. With a smoky backdrop from the wood aging, it has rich black-plum fruit and a serious concentration. It is going to age well, and will be ready to drink only from 2020."
"With 135 acres under vine, this is a large estate. The high percentage of Merlot in the blend gives this rich wine its ripe blackberry smoky fruits. It is juicy and really fruity with just enough tannin to give the wine shape. Drink this wine from 2020."
"The home chateau of the group of properties owned by the Guyon family, this estate has produced a solid very ageworthy wine. It has dark tannins and rich juicy black fruits. With its structure and bright berry and plum flavors, it will not be ready to drink before 2020."
"From one of a group of chateaus owned by the Guyon family of Rolland de By, this is an intensely fruity wine. It has finely balanced tannins and acidity along with smoky flavors and layers of delicious black currant fruit. Drink from 2019."

"Jean Guyon owns a group of estates in the northern Médoc village of Bégadan. This wine (blended by a former ""best sommelier in the world"") has a high proportion of Merlot. That produces a wine that is smooth and likely to develop easily and quickly. With its touch of tannin, it is balanced and fruity. Drink from 2019."
Ripe Merlot and layers of toasty wood flavors are the initial tastes of this young wine. It does have weight and plenty of blackberry fruit. The aftertaste is crisp and fruity with a dry edge from the young tannins. Drink from 2020.

"The wine is ripe, weighty and full of fruit. Its tannins are already softening into the blackberry flavors. The sole question about this wine is the excessive wood aging that has given a burnt edge. Hopefully, this blend of 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot will assert its natural fruitiness. Don't drink before 2020."
"This wine with its tight black-currant character, is still also firm with tannins. It has a juicy edge that will develop well as the wine matures. With crisp acidity and structure, it should age. Drink from 2018."

"There are strong elements of the wood aging in this structured wine. That gives it a dry character that still dominates the red fruits. It needs to develop. While it will always have a dry character, look for the fruit to shine with its berry flavors and acidity. Wait to drink until 2018."
The wine seems to have too much high-toast wood aging for its own good. This wood has masked the fruit and taken much of the richness of the wine. It could soften and broaden although it will probably remain too dry.
"This Cru Bourgeois estate has produced a structured wine that is still showing strong wood-aging flavors. Toasty as well as ripely fruity, it has firm tannins and good aging potential. The aftertaste is fruity and spicy. Drink from 2019."

"With vines close to the Garonne estuary, this estate benefits from a warm microclimate. In 2010, that gave a high alcohol wine that shows weight and concentration. It is dense, developing its tannins and rich black-plum fruits well. The alcohol does show in a burnt edge which is the downside of this otherwise finely balanced, maturing wine. Drink from 2018."
"This is a ripe concentrated wine, full of black-currant fruit and dense tannins. The two balance each other giving a wine that has weight and a medium-term future. Drink from 2018."

"Well made and balanced, this wine is full of red-currant and berry fruits plus layers of tannins. Structured and with a smoky character, it is fresh, fruity and will develop quickly. Drink from 2017."
"Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit. That solid structure suggests the wine will need time to develop. The aftertaste boosts a more juicy fruitiness."

"Almost ready to drink now, this is a rounded, smooth wine with only light tannins but plenty of fruitiness. It's not a big wine, balanced and juicy with attractive fruits. Drink from 2017."
"Lean and tannic, this wine has chocolate and bitter coffee flavors from over-extraction. The fruit is suppressed at this stage, with a bitter aftertaste."
Too enthusiastic use of wood has left this wine bereft of fruit and unbalanced.
The producer has probably used too much wood for the fruit and density of this wine. The toastiness does not allow any fruit to show through.

"Preuillac continues to out-perform its appellation with a rich, full wine that has structure and balanced wood-aging flavors.

"Rich, juicy and structured, this firm wine has great power and concentration along with a dark, dry core. It's almost too much of a good thing, very flamboyant and ripe. It still needs to age to be fully balanced."
"Unusually for the Médoc, this is a blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, rather than Sauvignon. That explains the lightly perfumed character of this full, still very tannic wine. It's structured and concentrated with a dry center and the potential of bright red fruits later. The wine needs aging, drink from 2016."
"One of the showpieces of the Médoc, this structured and firm wine has strong Cabernet flavors that give both dry tannins and juicy black currant fruits. Still youthful, this balanced wine is likely to age well. Drink from 2018."
"This is already an accessible wine, with ripe black fruits and a juicy character. It comes from the highest point of the Médoc (a mere 100 feet above sea level) on deep gravel soil, giving both texture and richness. Berry notes dominate, supported by firm tannins and ample acidity, which will allow the wine to age well. Drink now-2022."

"A tight wine, the tannins almost too much for the fresh but lightweight fruits. The wood element is poised to soften the edges of the acidity and black currant fruits, but it needs another six months. The aftertaste is dominated by soft Merlot."
"A wine that is lean and angular, austere, the fruit dominated by very dry tannins. It misses weight with the licorice, meaty flavors and a hard-edged structure."
"Very light, the fruit is soft, easily attractive but rather muted. Flavors are of spice, black figs and stewed plums, the acidity a factor along with the wood."
"A structured wine, full of fresh black berry fruits, red plum skins and fresh acidity. There is a bell pepper element, but the light texture is spiced and rounded with wood."
"The second wine of Médoc Château La Cardonne is a light, fruity wine with red berry fruits, acidity and a fresh tannin character. It is pleasingly ready to drink now."
"A wine that is perfumed with new wood. The fruit has the freshness of 2007, high acids, cranberry juice, not weighty. Needs to age for another year."
"Balanced but very firm, with dominant tannins, here is a wine with an angular feel to it. The tannins give a meaty character as well as laying alongside the plum skin flavors. It is dry, with some definite acidity."
"A wood-dominated wine, all the dryness coming from barrels rather than fruit. Will it broaden out? It's hard to find the fruit at the moment, but there is weight under the wood, so perhaps."
"This is the northernmost of the many properties owned by major Bordeaux personality, Bernard Magrez. It shares the same richness as many of the wines produced under his name while also having a light touch of acidity and black-currant crispness. With the ability to age, it will be ready from 2023."
"Smoky and spicy, this dense wine is rich with black-currant Cabernet Sauvignon layered with solid tannins. Juicy acidity cuts through this firm texture to give a crisper, lifted edge. The wine has a way to go, so don't drink before 2023."

"Offering attractive black-currant fruit, this wine is crisp as well as structured. Layers of tannins, berries and acidity are coming together well as the wine matures. Drink from 2022."
"Bright red fruits dominate this easy-drinking wine. It has some funky tannins, rustic perhaps, that intrude into the otherwise easy fruitiness of the wine."
"This wine has too much wood for its own good. By now, this should be softening but it is not. There's not enough room for what could be crisp berry fruit. It might soften, but the bitter wood-aging character suggests not."
This tight and mineral-driven wine is still firmly tannic. That core of dryness is likely to remain even while the black-currant fruit matures. Drink this wine from 2019.
"Soft and fruity, this is a light wine with gentle tannins and acidity. Black-currant fruits go with the crisp texture to make a wine that will be ready to drink from 2019."

They are there and will be show best from 2023."

"This northern Médoc estate has produced a wine that has both structure and fruit. The tannins are certainly present, giving a burnt character from the wood aging. However, black currant flavors are there as well. Put the two together as they integrate, and the wine will be juicy and attractive. Drink from 2020."

As the wine softens, it will broaden out to emphasize its richness and the warm fruit. Drink from 2023."
"The 39-acre estate is under the same ownership as Château les Trois Manoirs. This wine has a generous use of wood that has nicely stopped short of smothering the fruit.

"Vineyards in the Press family's 450-acre estate surround one of the Médoc's grand chateaus owned by Bordeaux elite over centuries.

"A serious commitment to wood aging has given this wine a dark-chocolate and extracted set of flavors. This masks the wine, which seems almost austere. It will likely remain tough."

"The Pagés family, which has a group of estates in the Médoc, has produced a rich, concentrated wine at this Château. While packed with black currant fruit from the 60% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, it also has a firm layer of tannins that will allow it to age. Drink from 2021."

"Firm, tense and dryly tannic, this is a solid wine, foursquare, its edges a little rough at present. The berry fruits are black, spicy from wood, creating a rich feel. In the end, black currant acidity and freshness finish the wine with a lift."
"Strong aromas of new wood are confirmed by the palate, where wood flavors dominate. This is a structured wine, showing fruit acidity under the wood and sufficient weight of red berry fruits to come through in another six months."
"A structured wine that gives pleasure from its ripe blackberry fruits as well as from its firm, food-friendly, spicy tannins. It has vibrant, vivid acidity that lifts the dense structure and gives an elegant feel to the close."
"A wood-laden bottling, produced from a selection of wines at Patache d'Aux. If the wood weren't currently so dominant, the blackberry fruits would have more of a chance. It obviously needs a year or two to smooth out and come into balance."
"This is big and dense. There seems to be too much structure and not enough fruit for the weight of the tannins. That said, there is also a good smoky character that gives spice and lifts the final black currant fruit flavor."
"Although initially austere, this wine then opens out well, giving a firm and structured character. There are spice, solid dry tannins and a fine layer of berry fruits, finishing off with lively acidity."

"Fine wood flavors, balancing with black berry fruits, red plums and some soft chocolate and vanilla. The tannins play a fine supporting role, leaving the vivacious fruit, with its delicious juicy character, to have the final word."
"This is lean and structured, with some juicy fruit showing through the bright berries, but also around a core of tannins, acidity, bell peppers and a cool aftertaste."
"A dense wine, with black fruits that go in one direction, and tannins that go in another. Maybe this is because it's young. There is some good, ripe acidity and blackberry flavors, so in six months, this may well integrate."
"A firm, rather lean, stalky wine, dominated by black currant flavors. The tannins are dry, dense. This will show best with food, its firmness and tannic character cutting well with rich meat."

"The origins of this estate date back to a medieval Benedictine monastery. Today, the 29-acre estate has produced a rich-almost too rich-wine. Its jammy blackberry fruits are spoiled by the hint of pepper that comes from the alcohol. Still, the fruit is ripe and dense with a backing of firm tannins. Drink from 2020."
The wine is tight with considerable tannins over the black-currant fruit. That makes for a structured dark wine with black-plum skins giving a firm texture. The wine will need time. Drink from 2021.
This is a spicy wine with some attractive red fruits. There is a rustic barnyard character that is less pleasing. The juicy acidity at the end does give a lift to what is a disappointing wine.
"The wine is seriously structured for the vintage: that means a wine that is full of tannins, dark and firm. It has concentration and black fruits, shot through with acidity. Drink this dense wine from 2018."

"The wine has red fruits and spice from wood aging. It suffers from the lean character of the vintage, giving a wine that shows tannins while not having enough fruitiness. Drink from 2017."

"This five-acre property has produced a ripe wine that is more about fruit than structure. Although there are tannins, the bold, black fruits and fresh acidity show best. The aftertaste is fruit with a generous texture. Drink from 2018."
"Heavy extraction has given the wine a dark, bitter-chocolate character along with a serious amount of toast flavors. The result is a wine that is tough and only hinting at the fruit. It will probably soften as it develops although that firm wood character will likely remain. Drink from 2018."
"This ripe, concentrated wine brings out the fruit of the vintage, ripe blackberries and currants. Tannins integrate well into the fruity character of the wine. Black cherry acidity comes through strongly at the end."

"Dominated by 80% Merlot with licorice and dark chocolate, the wine has strong flavors of new wood that give a vanilla and caramel character. It is solid, with a strong tannic presence. Put all this together and this is a wine that is likely always to be firm."

"Ripe and fruity, this is already a delicious wine. It has blackberry fruit, sweet tannins and acidity that percolates through the ripe texture. Generous and open, it is almost ready to drink."

"Ripe and extracted, this shows more of a bitter chocolate note than a fruit flavor. It has a very dry, firmly tannic character, with a dark, smoky feel. Powerful and concentrated, its pepper and spice tones accompany the note of black plum skin. Expect this to soften slowly over 4-5 years."
"This richly perfumed wine is firm with tannins, showing its high alcohol through a sharp peppery edge. It is dense and concentrated, almost too much so to pair with food."
"Far too young to even consider drinking, this is a wine whose potential comes from its rich, round, concentrated black fruits and its dense tannins. It's chewy and chunky; age for at least four years."
"Rich and firmly structured, this shows ripe berry and currant notes. It is dense and juicy, layered with wood notes and loaded with sweet tannins. Like many wines from Montagne-Saint-Émilion, it offers good value."

"This so-called satellite appellation of Saint-íˆmilion is able to produce attractive, forward wines, like this one. The ripe, soft structure brings out the black fruits, rounded out by sweet juiciness. There is a slight edge of astringency, but then the smoky wood and berry flavors kick back in."
"Yes, it has 2003 ripeness, but there is also some restraint here. The tannins are still defiantly young, the fruit packed with black plum jelly flavors. It promises 2-3 years' aging."
"Under any new classification, this should certainly be a classed growth. Today it is among the leaders of the crus bourgeois. The 2000 is opulent, generous, stylish. The tannins are ripe and sweet, the fruit is finely balanced. It will develop well over the next 10-15 years."

It has the elegance and delicacy of Moulis, as well as some good intensity of flavor. A wine that will certainly age for 10 years or more."
"Undoubtedly one of the two star properties in Moulis. Its quality is impeccable: a Cabernet-dominated wine, with superrich black currant flavors that retain great structure and aging ability. Enjoy this wine in 5-10 years."
"Made by the same team as neighboring Château Chasse-Spleen, the wine from this 17-acre estate is fruity, with the potential for a smooth texture and rich fruit. The wine has spice, juicy black currants and a delicious aftertaste. Drink from 2021."

"This is a small property under the same ownership as Château Paloumey. It is unusual in the 20% Petit Verdot that goes into the blend. That gives the wine its deep color and rich generous black-plum fruit. Solid and dense, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020."
"Not many people have Châteaus named after them. But Caroline Chanfreau-Philippon does and now she runs it as part of Château Lestage, both Cru Bourgeois. This is a rich and structured wine that is concentrated, ripe and juicy. With both attractive black-currant fruits typical of the vintage and firm tannins with tight structure, drink this wine from 2020."

"With its firmly tannic core, this is a rich and structured wine. It has a dense, fruit-driven texture, full of very fresh black plum and berry flavors. The tannins provide a dry counterpoint. It's a wine that will age; drink from 2018."
"One of the reliable wines from Moulis, this vintage of Anthonic shows a ripe, smooth character. Red fruits are underpinned by dusty, ripe tannins. It's going to develop well, although it will need time. Drink from 2018."
"Dating back at least to the 17th century, Duplessis was one a hunting lodge. Today, owned by the Lurton family, it has produced a dark and dense wine that has a dry structure at the moment, with a strong extraction character. However, the potential black fruits promise future richness. Drink from 2018."
"The team at neighboring Château Chasse-Spleen makes the wine here, giving the wine a sheen as well as enhancing its firm structure. Big tannins parallel black fruits in a promising mélange of flavors. It will age; drink from 2018."
"Layers of smooth, new-wood flavors dominate this full wine. Dark chocolate and black plum flavors show the wood and the fruit of the wine. It's already concentrated and richer than many wines in the vintage. Drink from 2018."
"This 19-acre property, in the same family since the 17th century, has produced a structured, Merlot-dominated wine that is as much about tannins as fruit. It's still young and all that juicy black currant fruitiness will blossom. Give it until 2017."
"Initially this wine is dry and very firm, dominated by extracted tannins. Gradually the black fruits assert themselves and give a more juicy view. Probably the 14 months in wood was too long and the wine needs time to recover. Drink from 2018."
"Powerful and structured, this has dense tannins that will always be an important part of the wine. The juicy, fresh fruit gives a perfumed character to the wine and brings out acidity as well as the dry texture. It needs to age, so drink from 2018."
"A dark, dry and firm wine, this is developing slowly. Its fruits show the influence of Cabernet in the blend with a strong tannic and black currant element. It will need several more years aging, so drink from 2018."
"This is turning into an impressive wine as it finds its way between solid tannins and ripe, full black fruits. It is dark and dense at this stage with tannins that dominate. A more juicy character will develop as the wine ages. Drink from 2017."
"This marks the first vintage of this Moulis estate under the ownership of the Barton family of Léoville Barton. Already the wine is showing breeding and an understated structure and richness. Lightly perfumed, full of black fruits and integrated tannins, it should age well. Drink from 2017."
"This perfumed wine is full of both tannins and juicy black fruits. The wood aging shows lightly on the palate but will integrate well with another year or two. Full and rich, it will be ready to drink by 2017."
"A perfumed wine, it has ripe tannins, soft and full black currant flavors and a solid structure. A dark, brooding character indicates the aging potential. Drink this concentrated wine from 2017."
"Ripe, full in the mouth and with a smooth, already silky texture, this is a generous wine. Its ripe blackberry fruits are juicy, while the tannins are soft and cushioned by the ripe fruits. This is a wine that will develop well, so drink from 2016."
"Made by the team from Château Chasse-Spleen, this elegant, smooth wine has deceptively firm tannins. The wine is dense, structured with plenty of juicy black currant fruits to balance. It will age, so don't drink before 2018."
"From an eight-acre vineyard, this is produced by the same team as Château Paloumey. Powerful and concentrated, it is also elegant, balancing its structure with good berry fruits and acidity. The tannins are still considerable, so drink from 2017."
"Solid and structured while fruity, this is a rich, Merlot-dominated wine. It has bold black currant fruit flavors and tannins that are already well integrated. It will develop over the medium term, so drink this juicy wine from 2017."
"This 20-acre vineyard produces a wine dominated by Merlot, lending the wine a smooth texture. The wine is rich with ripe plum flavors and only gentle tannins. It will age well over the medium-term, so drink from 2016."
"Hard around the edges, this wine does have some fruit, but this is masked by the bitter chocolate and burnt tannins. Juiciness surfaces in the aftertaste, but almost as an afterthought."
"A firm wine that has solid, dry tannins as well as rich fruit. It shows minerality, structure and a firm character that suggests potential for aging. The wine also has rich fruit that balances the density well, its acidity cutting through. Drink from 2016."
"Spicy and soft, this is an easy wine, fruity and showing the freshness of the vintage. It does have a background of smoky tannins that balance the fruitiness of the wine."
"89-91. Barrel sample. This chateau has been newly acquired by the Barton family of Léoville Barton. It's an attractive, fruity wine with warm tannins. The palate is fine and juicy, and finishes softly at the end."
"One of the many properties in Moulis with Poujeaux in its name, this estate has produced a classic, elegant wine, its Cabernet Sauvignon element providing a delicious black currant flavor, rounded out by the Merlot. Firm tannins still point the wine in the direction of aging, so give it four years and more."
"Already the structure is beginning to make way for ripe plum and damson fruits. With its firm structure, this is a complex and concentrated wine that will need to age over at least four years."
"This is concentrated, rich, full of blackberry fruits and layered with just the right balance of tannins. Chocolate and sweet fruits are given point by toast and an edge of spice."
"Dark colored wine, its fruit structured with building blocks of dense tannins, acidity and a plum skin texture. The wine has a fine balance, rich but also restrained and elegant. For aging over 3-4 years."
"A suave wine, concerned at this stage with its tannins and not with fruit. It is dry, the black plum skin texture just giving an opening to black currant fruits. All this means that this is a wine for aging-give it five years."
"Always an attractive wine, Anthonic is in good form in 2008. It has weight as well as fruit, giving a ripe, rounded character to go with its tannins. It feels dense, although not heavy, and has a solid chunky, smoky finish."
"Deeply embedded in firm tannins, this is a wine for aging. There is plenty of mineral, black currant and plum juice fruit, with a fine juicy element as well as acidity. It is balanced and harmonious, a keeper for 5-6 years."
"Big and dense, now developing well, the wine shows richness and complex fruit flavors as well as spice and dusty tannins. Licorice and dark chocolate go with damson plum flavors, never losing sight of the final juicy acidity."
"A serious, intense wine, a success for the vintage, with its dusty tannins, solid blackberry fruits and a firm core. The wine is weighty, maybe just giving a green pepper hint, but generally sitting foursquare in the mouth."
"The fifth vintage from this estate since its purchase by the Barton family of Léoville Barton in Saint-Julien, this is a generous, structured wine. It has ripe black fruits in profusion that are held together by the serious layer of tannins. Rich and concentrated, the wine will age for many years. Drink from 2024."
"Ripe, and densely textured, this wine shows an impressive, rich balance between fruit and tannins, with a dry core and broad black fruits that have great intensity. This wine, with 12 months in wood, conveys spice, concentration and excellent potential. Drink from 2024."
"The 70% of Merlot in the blend of this wine gives it richness and ripe red-berry fruits. The tannins, dusty and spicy, are a blend of the wood aging and the structure of the Cabernet Sauvignon. Ripe and juicy, the wine is packed with fruit and likely to age well. Drink from 2022."
"One of the properties owned by the Chanfreau family of nearby Fonréaud, this 14-acre estate has produced a structured, toasty wine. Its high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon gives it plenty of juicy black currants as well as fruit tannins. The wine needs to age and should be drunk from 2025."
"This is an impressively structured and balanced wine from Patrick Meynard. Rich black fruits are nourished by the spice and toast of wood aging for 14 to 18 months.Dense and juicy, this ripe wine likely will age well. Drink from 2024."
"A half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend, this wine is richly structured and packed with fruit. It has a perfumed character, juicy with blackberry flavors and acidity. Drink this opulent Patrick Meynard wine from 2024."
"A firmly structured wine, this is powerful and dense. It comes from a 14-acre property dominated by Merlot that gives the wine weight, rich fruit and juicy acidity. The result is a wood-aged wine full of spice and with a dry core that is packed with fruit. Drink from 2025."
"This wine comes from a six-acre property under the same ownership as Château Paloumey. It has 20% Petit Verdot in the blend, giving it both the tannins and the dark color. It is a structured wine, rich in black plums and densely textured. The wine will be ready to drink from 2024."
"This wine comes from a small 12-acre vineyard. Black-currant fruits and firm tannins keep the wine structured while maintaining a crisp character. The wine is simple, fruity and will be ready to drink from 2020."
"If anybody could source good fruit in Pauillac, it would be the winemaking team at Lafite-Rothschild. This wine, with its classic black-currant flavors, is structured while full of the ripe fruitiness and rounded character of the vintage. Drink from 2019."
"A small estate belonging to the owners of classed growth Croizet Bages, this wine is rich, densely textured and has good potential. It is young: both the tannins and the slight barnyard character testify to that. When it matures, it will be full and concentrated. Drink from 2022."
"This wine comes from a six-acre estate that belongs to the owners of neighboring classed growth Château Croizet-Bages. Get through the initial dirty barnyard character and there are density, generous tannins and black fruits. Hints of wood aging and juicy acidity are present along with a firm aftertaste. Drink this wine from 2022."
"Under the control of the winemaking team of Lafite, this estate is on a roll. This is a beautifully balanced wine, with complexity, richness and cassis, figs and black plums. It is developing relatively quickly, and will be ready to drink in two to three years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"A closed, austere wine; more solid than fruity, showing very firm tannins. There is a pronounced smoky character as well, with cigar box aromas and toasty flavors. What is certain is that this wine-racy and not too heavy-will develop slowly. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"A small proportion of Patrick Bernard's Haut-Médoc estate of Peyrabon is in Pauillac, and he uses the fruit to make a top Cuvée. This wine is suitably powered by dark Pauillac tannins, laced with some new wood and black currant fruits. It's powerful and dense, with considerable aging potential."
"Powerfully structured, with great depth and huge, ripe fruit, along with a muscular freshness of both fruit and tannins. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This wine is dominated by new wood, which goes right through the big, dark fruit flavors and tannins. Very ripe cassis flavors are under this wood, waiting likely for many years before the wood flavors subside. This is very much in the modern, polished style of Mouton today, made even more pronounced by the heat of  the 2003 vintage. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Considering the reputation of Lynch-Bages as a rich, polished wine, it is not surprising that, in 2003, the team of Jean-Michel Cazes and Daniel Lhose produced a superlatively ripe, opulent wine, one that could almost have come from Napa. But not quite: The fruit is compact and dense, with layers of acidity that speak more of  Bordeaux than California. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Normally one of the most elegant of Pauillacs, the 2003 is big and dense. These dark tannins mask delicious black fruit, flavors of spice and layers of acidity. This is going to develop relatively fast, despite the density of the wine, just because it is so rich. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This is a splendid wine. Yes, it is more powerful than the usual aristocratic Lafites,  but it still manages to retain a special air of great elegance and presence. The fruits are black, the tannins immensely powerful, the flavors are of black figs, dates, cocoa. At the end, there is a vibrant acidity that shows through, which promises a great life for this great wine. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"One of the best vintages for many years from this rather forgotten property. The wine is developing fast, already well integrated, powerful and dense, but dominated by attractive, ripe fruit. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"A great success for this fifth growth, run by Claire Villars. The 2003 is velvety, rounded, beautifully balanced. It is not a densely powerful wine, showing more elegance and seduction. It is already developing, and should be ready to drink in four or five years, maybe less. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This chateau, owned by one of the old Bordeaux families, the Bories, has only recently begun to gain the stature its vineyard, in the south of Pauillac, demands. This '03 is still very tight, packed with dark, tannic fruits, and dominated by a dense layer of wood. The price is still reasonable, which makes this a great wine for drinking after 10 years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This Clerc-Milon, under the same winemaking team as Mouton Rothschild, is an attractive wine, not heavy, already quite soft. It seems to have been heavily extracted, in a New World style, with new wood aromas and flavors, losing something of Pauillac, but a winner in that it's immediately attractive. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"On first whiff, it shows big fruit and vanilla, but it settles down on the palate to deliver cedary plum- and cassis-flavored fruit. Finishes long, with some dusty tannins. It's bulky and lacks a bit of grace, but it still makes for a satisfying mouthful of Bordeaux that should improve with time. Imported by Royal Wine Corporation."
"A small parcel of vines belonging to Château Peyrabon are in Pauillac and these are vinified separately as Fleur Peyrabon. This 2002 is piled with wood, dense tannins and dryness. What is missing at this stage is fruit, which is submerged by the dryness and tannins."
"This wine has a distinctly herbal aroma and flavor. Sage, thyme and broccoli come to mind. The tannins are firm and frame secondary flavors redolent of coffee, plum and charry toast. Finishes with moderate length. Kosher."
"Olive and pickle notes run on top of the fruit on the nose, while more olive character along with coffee and black fruit carry the palate. Vibrancy is not this wine's calling card; it's more dark, earthy and ultimately kind of flat."
"This is a powerful statement of ripe Cabernet Sauvignon. It has rich concentrated fruit, with ripe but dry tannins and considerable wood flavors. It is stylish, with layers of acidity and wood complementing the fruit."
"Typical of Lynch-Bages in its sumptuous rich style, this is a resounding success for the team of Jean-Michel Cazes. With its sweet fruit, opulent but balanced wood and red and black fruit flavors, it is a wine that will develop relatively quickly but will certainly age."
"Madame de Lencquesaing's estate has produced a stunner in 2000. The perfumes, delicate and sensuous, give it class, style and make it very memorable. It is delicious now, but there are tannins there, and deep, intense fruit flavors, waiting to develop slowly and surely."
"With its distinctive antique bottle and gold etched label dominated by a sheep, this is definitely a move away from classic Bordeaux bottling. It is good that the wine can support the presentation. The fruit is so ripe, it almost tastes of raisins, but that sweetness is finely balanced by the dry tannins and concentrated texture. To finish, there are exotic spices, giving an almost oriental character to the long aftertaste."
"This is such an expressive wine, with elegance a major factor in its character. It is certainly huge, rich and dense. But there is much more to it. You can peel layers of fruit and tannins away, and still never get to the end of the wine's complexity. At every stage of its life, it will reveal a new character, but for now it is dominated by powerful tannins and huge, black, fruit."
"Perhaps of all the first growths in the totally un-classic 2000, this retains most of the classic Bordeaux. It is certainly almost black in color, while the new wood flavors are very present. But it shows an impressive restraint, leaving the power of the wine to be revealed over the years rather than immediately. This could well be the longest-lived of the Pauillac first growths."
"An attractively proportioned wine, not big and powerful, but gentle and immediately attractive. There is plenty of black fruit there, along with soft tannins and fine acidity."
"The French call this wine harmonious, and it is balance that gives it its charm, its character and its intensity. It starts with black, dense fruits and only half way through do the tannins kick in. At the end, the whole is greater than the parts, with acidity the last lingering memory."
"The younger brother of Lafite, Duhart-Milon exhibits deliciously pure fruit. The wine is deceptively soft, because under the black jelly fruits, there are also dusty, dry, firm tannins. At the end, though, it is the vibrant fruit which lingers."
"This is a very modern style of wine, with generous new wood and super-ripe fruit flavors, balancing with polished solid tannins. Very international in style, it is good, but could come from anywhere."
"This fifth growth is punching above its class under the control of Claire Villars-Lurton (whose family also runs Chasse-Spleen and La Gurgue). The wine is foursquare, rich and solid, filled with firm tannins.Blackcurrant fruit flavors, herbs and acidity complet a serious style of wine."
"This is a finely structured wine with dark tannins and intense black fruits. The estate, with its biodynamically grown fruit, has given an impressively pure wine, packed with tight serious tannins and a fine structure of black-plum skins and intense acidity. It is direct, firm and with a huge potential over many years. Drink from 2027."
"This is a major wine. It has enormous tension, structure and a core of dark tannins. Amid all this, the wine is also packed with fruit and concentrated blackberry and black-plum flavors. It will age slowly and steadily with its enormous structure and concentration. Drink this wine from 2027."
"The label of this vintage is designed by David Hockney in memory of Philippine de Rothschild. It is a powerful wine in the rich style of Mouton with strong black-currant fruits from 81% Cabernet Sauvignon. It is dense and dark, ready to age for many years. Drink this impressive wine from 2026."
"With its 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a wine that is structured while marked with intense black currants. It has firm tannins and just a touch of wood. It is classic upright Bordeaux with its fine acidity and dry tannins. It will need to age, drink from 2024."
"A small part of Château Peyrabon (Haut-Médoc) is in the Pauillac appellation and is vinified and bottled separately. The wine delivers great fruit and equal richness. It is spice, packed with black plum and berry flavors. It is a powerful dense wine to age for several years. Drink from 2023."
"From a small parcel of land that is not designated as classed growth (rare in Pauillac), this is a richly satisfying wine. It is full of complex tannins as well as juicy red-berry fruits. There is also structure to give it the chance to age. Drink this wine with its delicious potential from 2022."
This is a new wine in this ever-expanding series. It reflects the structure and solid tannins of the appellation. It also brings out the juicy black-currant fruit of the vintage that will allow it to mature relatively quickly. Drink this attractive wine from 2019.
"This blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot comes from a small parcel of vineyards owned by the Borie family, which also has two Pauillac-classed growths. This wine is neat and finely formed with crisp fruit and attractive acidity. The tannins give support rather than domination. Drink from 2020."
"Warm and ripe, this is a beautifully balanced wine. It is packed with black-currant fruits that are bursting out of the glass. A darker side comes with the tannins and new wood flavors that are still prominent. It looks likely the wine will develop slowly, so don't drink before 2025."
"Fragrant and perfumed, this wine is the epitome of great Cabernet Sauvignon. It is fruity, juicy yet with serious concentrated tannins. There is spice from the wood aging along with a dash of pepper, all the while just bringing out the beautiful black-currant flavors. Drink this wine from 2024"
"This is rich, while also such a stylish wine. It is ripe and full of tannins while masking that firm structure with immensely generous fruit. The two give the wine power, density and elegance. Drink this impressive wine from 2025."
"Firm with dark tannins, this is a structured wine. It is still reticent, likely to take several more years to show its fruit. It is dense with the black-plum fruit behind the firm tannins. With all this concentration, expect this wine to need at least until 2024 before drinking."
"This Peyronie family cru bourgeois estate is one of the rare properties in Pauillac that is not a classified growth. That alone makes it a good value. The wine comes from vines close to Pichon Baron in the south of the appellation. This juicy black-currant flavored wine is still very young, full of its tannins and dark character. With its structure and acidity, the wine will age well. Drink from 2022."
"From one of those rare properties in Pauillac that are not classified growths, this wine is ripe, dark, still smoky and very structured. It has some of the weight of the vintage although in a restrained way, giving juicy black currant fruits behind the tannic structure. Drink from 2017."
"Produced on a small family-run estate that is surrounded by Bordeaux first growths, this wine is structured and firm. It has dark tannins and black currant fruit, together giving a ripe, smoky wine. The 40-year-old vines add to the concentration of this wine. Drink from 2019."
"This generous, almost opulent wine has both concentration and rounded fruits. It's open already, hinting at wood-aging while concentrating much more on the ripe fruits. Packed with fruit and tannins, it's densely textured. It will age, of course; don't start to drink before 2025."
"This wine is rich, with generous black plum and berry fruits. It has a structure that is full, ripe and that will sustain the fruitiness of the wine over many years. The sensation is of velvet, with some force behind it. This remarkable wine will develop well over the medium term and then age for many years. Drink from 2022."
"Unusual for a Bordeaux, this is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. It has plenty of tannins, although they are embedded in the pure black-currant fruits and the acidity. It shows the gentle side of Comtesse-fruit and freshness-although with spice and a touch of wood that are likely to balance soon. The wine will develop well over the next few years. Drink from 2022."
"This is a structured wine, firm with tannins and still showing some of the wood-aging. Red-berry fruits are cut with crisper blueberries and considerable acidity. This is going to be a firm wine that is lightened by the fruit, and a very good representative of the vintage. Drink from 2020."
"This is a structured wine, packed with black-currant fruits and fresh acidity. It is already becoming balanced with the finely drawn structure in balance with the perfumed fruits. Drink from 2018."
"Offering some of the few relatively good-value wines from Pauillac, this 50-acre property has made an impressive wine in this tough year. It is structured and dense although the black-currant fruitiness shows that it will develop quickly to be drinkable from 2020."
"Consultant Denis Dubourdieu has made the most of the difficult vintage, bringing out the fruit and ripe black-currant flavors. This balanced wine will develop attractively and quickly. Drink from 2019."
"A small portion of Château Peyrabon lies in the Pauillac appellation and is vinified separately. This is a surprisingly light wine for its appellation, fresh with fruitiness rather than structured. It has attractive black-currant acidity and a core of smoky tannins. Drink from 2018."
"After the promise of the wine at its initial barrel tasting, this bottled wine is less exciting. Berry fruits are muted by the extracted tannins. It's likely the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2018."
"This small estate is wedged between some of the classed growths of Pauillac. Firm and structured, the wine is solid with tannins and backed with concentrated blackberry fruits. The 60% Cabernet in the blend gives great acidity as well as the tannins. These two elements will allow the wine to age, so drink from 2018."
"This is the second wine of Château Pibran, whose vineyard is situated close to those of the the first growths of Mouton and Lafite. Structured and dense, this is a solid, powerful wine, packed with juicy black currant fruits and generous tannins. Give this wine until 2018 before drinking."
"Lafite's second wine is much closer to a balance of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that the first wine. It's also a properly rich, satisfying wine that is as much fruit as structure. Packed with blackberry fruits, it has a fresh character that dominates the firmer tannins and touch of bitter chocolate. Drink from 2020."
"This marks an impressive step forward for this wine that's so often been in the shadows of other wines in the Lafite-Rothschild stable. It's dense and structured as well as deliciously fruity. The wine is straight down the line, starting with perfumed acidity and finishing with blackberry fruit. Intense and tannic, it's likely to age. Drink from 2020."
"Now firmly in its new cellars, Clerc-Milon's wine is performing at the top of its form. This is a dense wine with juicy acidity as well as sweet tannins and ripe blackberry fruits. They give a ripe wine that is finely structured. The juicy aftertaste, typical of this vintage, is appealing although it does not detract from its power and longevity. Drink from 2022."
"Showing the serious side of Lafite, this is big and dark, powered by tannins as much as fruit. The wood aging is still showing, although that will integrate into the great structure that holds up the ripe black currant fruits. Totally dominated by some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Bordeaux, this wine has strength while also having great freshness. Drink from 2024."
"This is a beautifully opulent wine, great Mouton in its richness and succulent fruits. It's combines structure and obvious new-wood aging with hugely ripe black plum and currant flavors. While it is a pleasure to taste now, there is a great tannic structure in the background to give the sense of power and aging potential. Drink from 2024."
"Fruity and rich, this wine is developing fast. It is full of black currant fruits, with an impressive background of solid, structured tannins. The wine is linear, fresh, showing how well this property is developing its quality. It's a wine for medium-term aging, so drink from 2018."
"From the southern end of the Pauillac appellation, Fonbadet has illustrious neighbors such as Château Latour. Typically Cabernets dominate the blend, giving a powerful impetus towards aging. It's a wine that is punching above its status, with solid tannins and impressive black currant fruits. Drink from 2018."
"One of the few great values from Pauillac, this 10-acre estate has produced an attractive perfumed wine that expresses both ripe black fruit and great structure. It's not a wine for long aging with its already-fragrant acidity. It has sweet tannins, delicious fruitiness and a lengthy aftertaste. Drink from 2019."
"This wine is soft and fruity with ripe berry fruits and gentle tannins. For a major second wine, it's surprisingly easy and soft, developing fast with its berry fruits, chocolate and wood flavors at the end. Drink from 2017."
"The second wine of Château Pibran, this is ripe, juicy and attractive now. Black and red fruits burst from the glass, giving a rich character. That is balanced with refreshing acidity and a light tannic character. The wine will develop quickly, so drink from 2017."
"There is a lightness about this vintage of Mouton Rothschild. It doesn't take away from its quality but does give the wine poise and an attractive lift. The wine is based on solid tannins, then the ripe fruit builds layers of fruitiness and freshness. It is not likely to be one of the longest-aging Moutons, but it will be delicious. Drink from 2020."
"This wine is characterized by both structure and rich fruitiness. A dark, smoky character brings out the solid tannins that underlie the black currant fruitiness and the balance. Although it doesn't have power, an intensity gives a flavor that lasts in the mouth. Drink this wine from 2018."
"Continuing its impressive development, Clerc Milon 2011 is a serious wine. It is elegant, stylish, its fruits well integrated with red berry and plum skin flavors. Powerful while round and fruity with a fine sense of weight, this wine will develop relatively quickly but will then stay at its peak for many years. Drink from 2017."
"So smooth, this is a rich, grandiose wine. Although it is full of black currant fruits and spice flavors, the texture is most impressive. Dusty tannins are integrated with juicy fruits seamlessly. The purest fruit flavors are allied to linear tannins in a precise yet generous way. The wine is evolving beautifully, but do not drink before 2020."
"The wine shows the power typical of a Lafite but within the context of the fruity 2011 vintage. The immensely dense tannic structure gives the wine a solid feel that is lifted by so much ripe black currant and berry fruits. At the back, the wine has a more brooding, dark character that suggests great aging potential. Drink this wine from 2019."
"Big tannins and impressive fruits are the hallmarks of this impressive wine. It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure. For this fruity vintage, it shows a strong sense of direct, solid structure, only allowing the strong black plum and berry flavors to come through slowly. It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later."
"Duhart-Milon continues to get better and more sophisticated. This 2011 vintage shows that trend well with its elegant spice, black currant fruits and firm tannins. The fruitiness is well focused, with typical Cabernet acidity bringing out the fresher side of the wine. Drink from 2017."
"This is a solid, concentrated wine from a reliable chateau. It has weight and power, with rich black fruits balanced with fresh acidity. Touches of bitter extraction and wood aging are likely to integrate as the wine ages. It should develop into an impressive and powerful wine. Drink from 2018."
"Reflecting the fruity, forward style of the vintage, this wine is packed with ripe black currants. There is a strong Cabernet character-it's dry initially, then followed by juiciness. It's a concentrated wine, although not for long-term aging. Drink from 2017."
"This estate continues to rise in quality, and this bottling is a serious and dense wine. It has obvious flavors of wood aging, but balanced with rich blackberry fruitiness. The texture is dark and concentrated. Drink from 2017."
"Don't be fooled by the easy fruitiness of this delicious wine, because underneath the blackberry flavors is a powerfully tannic structure. Opulent and dense, it promises considerable aging. Drink this complex wine from 2018."
"Right next door to Mouton Rothschild, this small property is producing wines that are dominated by the rich, firm Cabernet Sauvignon of Pauillac. The weight and density are very present, a solid dry core surrounded by delicious black currant fruits. A wine that will mature relatively fast because of the vintage."
"Almost black in color, this stunning wine is gorgeous, rich and dense. It's grand and powerful, with a strong sense of its own importance. The beautiful tannins and the fragrant black currant fruits are palpable. It's a great wine, with huge potential."
"One of the chateaus owned by négociant Borie-Manoux, Lynch-Moussas has produced a fine, stylish 2010, which is firmly based on Cabernet Sauvignon. The fruit is rich and ripe, dominated by a blackberry note and underpinned by tannins. This is a chateau to watch."
"With advice from consultant and Bordeaux University professor Denis Dubourdieu, Batailley has improved immensely in the past few years. This 2010 reinforces that trend, revealing a wine that is structured with Cabernet Sauvignon and is attractive with black currant fruitiness. Age for the medium-term."
"A wine that is both fruity and almost approachable now, it is packed with the great structure of Pauillac Cabernet Sauvignon. It's rich and firmly tannic, layering plums and blackberries within a dark texture. This should be aged for at least five years."
"This small Pauillac property, close to Château Pontet-Canet, has produced an impressive 2006, structured with firm tannins under the black currant fruit."
"This shows the lean character that comes from the vintage. But it's balanced with juicy black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that are now maturing. This is attractrive for a light, ready-to-drink wine."
"Attractive mint aromas lead to a wine that is now mature. It's black currant fruit is layered with spice, herb and a dry structure that is not going to soften. Ready to drink now in a firm, austere way."
"94-96. Barrel sample. Like so many wines in this vintage, this shows black-currant acidity. It's lively and fruity, with the firm tannins providing a counterpoint."
"With a structure that runs between acidity and dark smoky tannins, this is a wine with potential opulence. It's very rich in character, dense and dark. The black plum flavors are dominant, along with excellent acidity. For the long-term."
"A seductive wine, deliciously ripe with the softest, juiciest fruit over smoky new wood. The wine shows intense fruit as well as a soft Merlot core. The tannins are beautifully integrated in this ripely sweet wine."
This wine continues the upward progression of Clerc-Milon. It has weight and density while also showing sweetness and delicious acidity. A very complete wine.
"Smooth black currant fruit with great density as well as superripeness. The wine is charming, while still having a powerful structure. Still a relative value in Pauillac, Batailley is now showing real class."
"A complex, dusty tannin wine, layering smoky wood and black fruits with a the firmest dry character. Very intense, rich, dense and potentially powerful."
"Deliciously fruity, with chocolate notes and acidity. The wine has dense but soft tannins that merge seamlessly into the black fruits. It is ripe, sweet, densely juicy."
"Mint aromas hint at the wood, but more important is the massive Merlot fruit that is an essential element in the blend. The result is a wine that blends richness and power with an initially severe character. Slowly it opens to reveal opulent blackberry jam flavors, immensely ripe."
"The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated."
"A dense, immense, solidly powerful wine. The ripest fruit overflows, paralleling the dark, solid tannins. As so often, Lynch-Bages is a blockbuster, dark and concentrated, with immense aging potential."
"A big, powerful wine that sums up the richness of the vintage. It is densely fruity, spicy with an enormous black plum and berry fruit character to go with the acidity. It's concentrated while still showing such wonderfully pure fruit. The aging potential is immense."
"From the vineyard associated with the hotel of the same name and owned by the Cazes family of Lynch-Bages, this is a dense Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine. It has power and structure, its black fruits on the dry side, concentrated and ready for aging. It should be kept at least four years."
"From 12-acre vineyard in Pauillac, a wine that is relatively affordable. It has fine Cabernet Sauvignon juicy black currant fruits, along with tannins that, in 2009, are so well integrated into the fruit already. The dusty texture promises good aging."
"Soft and juicy wine, all blackberry fruit and attractive acidity. There is a smoky wood edge just to add extra interest, while tannins are light and sweet."
"As so often, the wine is foursquare, tough and dark. It has powerful tannins with the weight of fruit well behind at this stage, structure to the front. It needs several years to come into balance."
"The small Pauillac vineyard close to some of the first growths is able to bring out all the Cabernet-dominated structure of the appellation. Look for black currant fruits, dark tannins and dense texture. Age for six years."
"Smooth, with dense tannins hidden behind the ripe, pure fruit, this important wine shows class and an impeccable balance of fruit and tannin. Rich as well as structured, this is a beautiful wine."
"Big and bold for the year, the tannins quite solid with a tight character. The fruit flavors are rich and intense, spiced with toast and acidity. Through it all goes the tell-tale 2007 streak of acidity."
"Rich, impressively ripe fruit, the fruit dense and black, with juicy black plum flavors followed by dusty tannins. The wine is chunky, powerful for the year, the dryness smoothed by new wood."
"A dark charactered wine, with solid tannins and firm, extracted fruit flavors. The berry fruits are juicy and sweet, with the dusty tannins coming from the Cabernet in the blend. The finish is softer, more black jelly in texture."
"This is a wine for aging. The tannins are dense, very dry with a feel of extraction. It takes a while for the black currant fruit to show through, with acidity and freshness dominant. The wine is still settling, and time will bring the fruit into line with the tannins."
"Slowly the potential of this impressive wine is coming out. It is rich, the new wood flavors blending with the ripe blackberry sweetness and tight tannins. Chocolate flavor power through this concentrated wine."
"For the year, this is a big wine, a success. New wood flavors and tannins blend well with the weight of fruit, depth of flavor and concentration. The wine has freshness to give with the structure, solid and intense. Certainly for aging-five years and more."
"The wood element is important here, but it is based on a firm Cabernet Sauvignon structure, dry but rich tannins. The wine is a great success for the vintage, giving sweetness, ripe fruit that only shows light extraction, and dark plum and berry flavors. The feeling is of polished fruit and wood, rounded but always dense."
"A big and powerful wine, with tannins that are compact and dense. The dryness of the tannins go right to the core, surrounded by chocolate, sweet fruit and dark berry flavors. The wine is well structured, big and bold, with plenty of firmness promising aging."
"Fresh and juicy, with bright acidity and some solid tannins. Flavors of spice accompany an edge of green fruit. The aftertaste is tannins and wood."
"While this wine has pleasant fruit, there are also some dark edges of black berries and rough tannins. The focus is shaded, still developing."
"Showing, coffee and sweet juicy fruit, the wine has a light touch, freshened with acidity and strengthened lightly with tannins. There is a meaty character, but the wine does finish a little hollow."
"A finely made wine, with elegant fruit and tannins, but definitely on the light side. The red berry fruits are soft and juicy, already a pleasure to drink, with only short-term aging."
"Soft, juicy and fruity, relatively light in character. The tannins are fresh, supporting black currant and fresh, juicy fruit flavors. It's easy and open, developing well, but quickly."
"A wine that has freshness, some wood and a soft series of tannins, almost velvet. There is a stalky juiciness here, to complete a wine that offers the freshest acidity, with only hints of darker fruits."
"A concentrated wine, relying on its generous black currant juice fruit rather than the more reticent tannins. The wine is dominated by Cabernet juiciness, a burst of fruit in the glass."
"An intense and concentrated wine that succeeds well. It has plenty of freshness, but also sufficient firm tannins to offer aging potential. Wood is prominent, but not dominant, finishing with the freshest of berry fruits."
"Lean and austere, this is a tannic wine, with medicinal aromas, spice, stalky currant fruit flavors and tight texture."
"This portion of the Fonbadet vineyard in Pauillac has ripe layers of black-currant-flavored Cabernet Sauvignon along with firm tannins. The polished character comes from the wood aging that also brings in spice and toast. But it's the fruit that shines here, ripe, balanced and sure to see the wine age well. Drink from 2023."
"This is the second vintage in this range from Bordeaux's top Left Bank appellation. The wine is structured, with the class to be expected of a Pauillac. The black-currant fruitiness of Cabernet Sauvignon dominates, giving elegance and a rich texture at the same time. The wine needs time, so drink from 2021."
"This is a great vintage from Lafite. The profile is rich in feel, with a seriously firm tannic structure. Solid, complex and with great authority, this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant wine is impressively dense in dark-fruit tones. It will age for many years. Drink from 2027, although that would almost be too soon."
"This wine comes from a 50-acre crus bourgeois estate in the middle of some of the greatest crus classés estates. The terroir is impressive and produces a rich, structured wine with good concentration, ripe tannins and a sumptuous bed of black fruits. The wine is likely to age well; drink from 2025."
"This is the Pauillac-appellation portion of a larger vineyard, Château Peyrabon, which is in the Haut-Médoc. The wine is rich, perfumed and likely to age very well. Juicy acidity and firm texture go with the black-currant fruit in a wine that will become balanced and elegant. Drink from 2024."
"This is the new taste for this estate: richly endowed while remaining elegant and suave. Certainly, there is great concentration here as well as rich black fruits. But they are given a sense of style and poise that will remain with this wine as it ages. Drink from 2026."
"This vintage was ideal for the rich style that this estate has made its own. This wine is full bodied and ripe with black-currant and dark berry fruits. The tannins fall into the cushioned wine with ease and richness. Of course, the wine should be aged, so wait until 2026."
This is one of the great successes of this vintage. It is generous and rich while also solid and structured. The combination of the essence of black currant and the elegant tannic structure are superb. This is a wine for serious aging and the wine should not be broached before 2026.
"The wine from this estate, owned by one of the great Bordeaux families, is already balanced between fruit and tannins. Black currants from the Cabernet Sauvignon comes through strongly, giving a juicy character to the wine's structure. It is rich and will mature well. Drink from 2025."
"This is one of the three biodynamic estates that are owned by Gonzague and Claire Lurton. The wine is generous while also firmly structured in the style of this property. A dense, dry core surrounded by blackberry and black-currant fruit promises great things. It finishes clean, clear and crisp. Drink from 2024."
"This is a vastly improved estate, making impressively good wines in recent vintages. The wine is structured and tannic but also packed with black-currant fruits, good acidity and spice. It will take time to develop, so drink from 2025 at the earliest."
"This generous, ripe wine is filled with fine tannins as well as juicy black-currant fruits. It is approachable in the sense that the fruit is so delicious. However, watch for those tannins that are firm and dense and will allow the wine to age. Best to wait until 2024."
"Ripe and spicy, this wine comes from an estate on the western edge of Pauillac. Young fruit, toast and fine tannins are combining well into a rich wine that is likely to develop relatively quickly, very much in the style of this property. Drink from 2024."
"This wine is tough and extracted, with dark-chocolate flavors as well as tannins. Its hard outer shell is rescued by the ripe black-currant fruits of the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink from 2025."
"The second wine of classed growth Château Duhart-Milon. With its mint and herbal aromas, its rich velvet texture flavored with black plums and damsons, this is already a sophisticated wine that will be ready to drink in a year."
"The second wine of Château Duhart Milon in a top year such as 2005 is the equal to many chateau Bordeaux. It has good depth of blackberry and red plum fruits, ripened by sweet acidity, layers of wood and spice, and a great finishing balance."
"The success of this wine owes as much to Merlot as to Cabernet. The Merlot has created the ripeness and smoothness of the wine. While the Cabernet keeps it firm and closed up, there is a base of rich, sweet fruit here that will show over the next two years. The style of the wine is moving away from elegance to power under the new regime of owners, Champagne Roederer."
"Year after year, Lynch-Bages is able to produce sumptuous wines, typically rich, powerful and structured. This is solid, the blackberry ripe fruit enveloping this structure with a velvet sheen. This is developing into one of the successes of the vintage."
"Fresh, fruity, relatively lightweight, this offers immediately pleasurable drinking. Tannins give a counterpoint, but only play a minor role. For drinking over the next 2-3 years."
The winemaking team of Château Lafite makes one of the better branded Bordeaux. This 2006 has tobacco aromas followed by flavors of fresh black currants with an attractive smoky character and a fine line of balancing acidity.
"Classic Lynch-Bages with just a bit of extra power and richness. While the tannins are structured, it is the velvety fruit that rolls around the mouth that is the most dominant character. It is coming together into a wine that will be big and dense, but never over the top."
"A great, classic Pauillac, with its dark, dense, almost black currant flavors stirred together with immense tannins. The layers of dryness, fresh fruits, acidity and ripeness are all coming together into a magnificent structure. Age for at least 20 years."
"This wine is initially dense, almost thick enough to be cut with a knife. But then it becomes apparent that this is beautifully integrated and balanced, bringing together power, with the hallmark Lafite style and poise. In the end, you have a wine that promises an impressive aging potential along with delicious black currant fruits, acidity and a layer of striking tannins. Imported by Domaines Barons de Rothschild and multiple U.S. importers."
"A great wine, the summation of a great vintage in Bordeaux. The core of richness, the dense, bone-dry tannins, the black currants, red berries and black plum skins are the elements, but it's the way they have been integrated that makes this such an impressive wine. There is great elegance as well, a fabulous counterpoint to such power. Cellar for at least 15 years, but this will keep forever. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates and multiple U.S. importers."
"Big, fruity and softly structured, this is a fresh, juicy wine with a fine tannic element. The  black currants, black plum skin tannins and vibrant acidity pair with a dry center that gives balance."
"A big, sweet, soft wine, with attractive ripe blackberry fruits. It's lively, smoky and licorice flavored, with delicious fresh acidity to finish."
"Made by the Pauillac cooperative, this is a pleasant, lightweight wine, a surprise considering the vintage. There are black currant flavors, but the wood element is too dominant for the fruit."
"The vines of this Domaines Rodrigues-Lalande estate grow around the village of Martillac, neighboring some of the area's top classed-growth estates. The wine, well balanced between Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, is rich while well structured with spice and tannins. With its great fruit and ripe character, the wine will age. Drink from 2022."
"This reserve wine is a powerful and ripe expression of Cabernet fruit, both Franc and Sauvignon. It has firm tannins, bold berry flavors and a rich finish. Drink this wine from 2021."
"Ripe fruit and rich tannins mark this wine out. It shows a blend of structure and ripe fruit, along with firm young tannins. It has good potential with its generous black-fruit flavors. Drink this complex wine from 2021."
"This rich Domaines Rodrigues-Lalande wine is already well balanced. It has dense, dusty tannins, rich blackberry flavors and a general sense of comfortable ripeness. Its structure and concentration don't detract from its elegance. Drink this full wine from 2022."
This wine shows all the fruitiness that is characteristic of this attractive vintage. It also brings in ripe berry fruits along with a background of firm tannins. Drink this structured wine with its appealing fruit from 2019.
"José and Brigitte Rodrigues-Lalande are gung-ho on Pessac-Léognan. This ripe wine is ready-to-drink, full of black-currant fruit, spice and well-integrated tannins. With its balanced acidity, it is ripe and smoky with a crisp aftertaste. Drink now."

"A well-balanced wine with dry fruits, flavors of black currants and fine, fresh fruit. It is not a big wine, but benefits from elegance and freshness. It is ready to drink now."

"From the same stable as Haut-Brion, La Tour Haut-Brion reveals a fruity, almost frivolous character that makes it immediately charming. But there is no question that the soft, rich, black jelly fruits are the mask for a more concentrated, tannic structure. Give it 5-10 years."
"Under the attention of the Miecaze family, this ancient estate has burst out of a dormant period and into new life with vineyards, a winery, a restaurant and a B&B. This latest vintage is powerfully dense and with great swathes of tannins and perfumed fruit. The wine is stylish, while also being ripe and full in the mouth. It has fine potential and will be ready from 2020."
"The second wine of the Kressmann family's Latour-Martillac, produced from young vines, has some of the same firm structure and ripe black-currant fruit. Everything is just that bit more mature, giving a ripe fruit-packed wine with a balanced core of tannins. Drink from 2019."
"Richly endowed, the wine is beautifully concentrated. Still young it has considerable potential with its rich fruits and firm tannins. There is a strongly juicy aftertaste that brings in the freshness of the year. The wine will age well, and should not be drunk before 2026."
Initial tight acidity in this crisp wine gives way to smooth rich black fruits. This already has a fine balance with its ripe juiciness and delicious red-berry flavors. It is going to develop into a very fine wine. Drink from 2024.
"The wine is powered both by its tannins and by its great fruit. Dark and dense both in the structure and the black-plum flavors, it is very fine wine- juicy and ripe. This is a serious wine with a great future. Drink from 2026."
"Tight tannins mask the ripe fruit in a wine that is set for long-term aging, so there is a dry core that dominates at the moment. But not for long: the bold black fruits are insistent and are going to be delicious. This is a structured wine that will be ready in 2026."
"This is a powerful wine, made to age for a long time, from this estate which is performing in top gear. Complex tannins and dark fruits both make their presence felt. It has weight, ripeness and a dense structure. A great success, it is unlikely to be ready to drink before 2027."
"With seriously dense tannins, this shows great structure. Rich and full of ripe fruit, it also has a fresh streak that gives it a lift. The structure will allow the wine to age over many years while the fruit and acidity will give it crispness. Drink this impressive wine from 2027."
"From one of the major estates in Pessac-Léognan, this is a fine, stylish and tightly structured wine. It has spice and intense acidity to balance the dark tannins and black-currant fruit. It is going to need several years to really mature. The estate is owned by André Lurton who was influential in creating the Pessac-Léognan appellation. Drink from 2024."
"This is a tightly coiled wine, still firm and packed with tannins as well as fruit. It has a strong dry core that is lifted by the bright acidity. This is going to be a very complete wine, all the elements well in place. Drink from 2026."
"Ripe and richly fruity, the wine is full bodied with great acidity as well as firm tannins. It will keep for many years. Bold tannins and a fine tension between the fruit and acidity are all promising for the future. Drink this impressive wine from 2025."
This is a finely perfumed wine. It has a strong sense of structure with its tight tannins. It also has lively crisp red fruits that give both acidity and richness to a wine that will develop well. Drink from 2025.
"Firm and structured, this is a dark still-young wine. With a strong tannic core, it is concentrated, the black fruits are firmly in the throes of the tannins. Give this impressively serious second wine of Haut-Brion time. Drink from 2022."
"This is a structured wine that also has great layers of rich black fruits. They give the wine weight and intensity that is lifted by acidity. It is a powerful complex wine, concentrated and ripe. Drink from 2025."
"Named after the Pontac family which in the 18th century owned large swathes of Bordeaux and its vineyards, this estate is based around a former hunting lodge. The wine is ripe and full, finely structured and with tight still-young acidity. Drink from 2022."
"This is a finely perfumed wine with its dark tannins and juicy black-currant fruit. It has structure and a dense texture although this is filled with the bright acidity that gives the wine a lift. This will age well, so drink from 2021."
"This is the second wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. It is rich with tannins and juicy with black-currant acidity. As befits a second wine, it is developing well and easily. Drink from 2021. While it shares the same name as Château Haut-Brion, there is no ownership or location connection between the two properties."
"This is a fine wood-aged blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Petit Verdot. It is darkly colored, dense and with great ripe tannins. One of several Bordeaux properties owned by the Thiénot family, this estate occupies a fine, gravel outcrop in the Pessac-Léognan region, just south of Bordeaux. Drink from 2024."
"The estate is within the urban area of Bordeaux, an oasis of green in the busy city. It is a smooth, rich wine that has benefited from the consultancy work of the late Denis Dubourdieu. Ripe tannins and fine acidity support the black currant and plum fruits. The wine is developing well. Drink from 2020."
"This is a ripe soft wine full of warm fruits and gentle tannins. The second wine of the always-impressive Château Smith Haut Lafitte, it is a rich wine its own right. With black currant and dark plum flavors, it has some solid tannins from 60% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink from 2018."
"The wine shows the firmly tannic structure of the vintage. It is dense, packed with dark fruits and dry tannins that are slowly developing. That makes for a rich, black-fruited wine, concentrated and needing to age further. Drink from 2018."
"With a high proportion (60%) of Merlot, this is a ripe wine while also being structured. It has a dense character that comes from the still young, firm tannins. Behind these are the ripest black-currant fruits, crisp and juicy, packed with flavor as well as acidity. Drink this wine from 2019."
"Dense, concentrated and firm, this wine has a powerful, rich structure that promises well. Big berry fruits and dark tannins are developing well together. The wine is full of promise so drink from 2020. Fifteen-percent of the 74 acres of vines are more than 120 years old. New York banker Robert G. Wilmers bought Haut-Bailly in 1998 from the Sanders family, owners since 1955. Véronique Sanders-van Beek has run the estate since then."
"Powerful and dense, this wine has great potential. With full-bodied blackberry fruits and acidity that push through the dark tannins, it shows a rich character that is impressive for the year. Drink from 2020. The property has been owned since 1999 by Sophie Lurton of neighboring Château Bouscaut."
"This wine is rich while at the same time having a stalky character that gives smokiness, texture and acidity. These combine with black-currant flavors that finish the wine with great freshness. It's a light vintage for this estate, fruity and certainly for the medium-term. Drink from 2020. The estate has been in the Dillon family since 1985."
"This wine has considerable potential, with rich tannins and firm fruits. It is solid, very dry at this stage although this is balanced by dark plum skin and blackberry flavors. The wine will develop slowly, so don't drink before 2022. The first harvest at this estate was in 1252. The property is now owned by Bernard Magrez, a wine, art, culture and gastronomy patron."
"This wine is structured with impressively ripe fruit. Black-plum juice and blackberries are balanced with a strong tannic content that gives the wine backbone and structure. It has weight, although with its already exuberant fruitiness, it is not likely to be really long-term wine. Drink from 2024. From 120 acres, only the best grapes go into this top wine and 2013 was a smaller crop than the average (10,000 to 12,000 cases). Believed to be the oldest of the five Bordeaux first growths, Haut-Brion has been in the Clarence Dillon family since 1935. The current president is Prince Robert de Luxembourg."
"This wine shows the continuing evolution of this property even in a difficult year. Structured, balanced tannins are already integrated with the fresh black-currant fruits. With a balance between Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the wine is fruity and still young. Drink from 2019."
This impressive wine is full of potential. Powerful wood flavors are currently masking the fruitiness of the wine. However the weight of fruit and the rich texture promise good long-term aging.
"Dense and structured, this ripe and fruity wine features attractive dense tannins that are balanced by rich black-currant fruit flavors. The acidity and the dry core of the wine both promise good aging, so drink from 2020. The property has been in the Ballande family since early 19th century. Red-wine production from the 50 acres is overseen by consultant Denis Dubourdieu."
"André Lurton bought de Rochemorin in 1973, an estate with vines since the 16th century. This is an aromatic wine, perfumed with blackberry tones. It has plenty of fresh fruit, soft tannins and ample acidity. The structure plays a supporting role-dry while also showing some richness. Drink from 2019."
"Rich and ripe, this wine full of blackberry fruits and balanced tannins has improved since it was reviewed from barrel. It has good concentration for the vintage, dominated by black fruit that offers good acidity at the end. Drink from 2022. Olivier is a large medieval hunting estate that has belonged to the Bethmann family since the 19th century."
"While showing too much wood at the moment, this wine has potential. The red berries and black currants promise a fruity future with good tannins in support. Give the wine a few years and drink from 2019."
"The enthusiastic use of wood for this wine gives a dark, spicy character that masks any fruit. Less new wood would have helped highlight the natural fruitiness of the wine. Leave it until 2020 and the fruit may fill out. Winemaker Stephan Carrier returned from Napa to take over winemaking after Irish businessman Lochlann Quinn bought the property in 2001."
"This full and structured wine offers good acidity, firm tannins and layers of black-currant flavors. It has good potential with richness, weight and balance. Drink from 2019."
"This is a big and juicy wine full of blackberry and dark-plum flavors. The second wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion, it is fruity with dominant Merlot and round and perfumed Cabernet. It is developing rapidly into an accessible, ripe wine. Drink from late 2016."
"This is a concentrated wine, full of blackberry fruits with acidity and spice. The wood-aging character is balancing out well, giving structure without dominating the fruit. Drink from 2020. Grapes are vinified by variety and plot from the 60-acre vineyard of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), Merlot (40%) and Petit Verdot (5%). The property was purchased by Jean-Christophe Mau in 2004."
"Ripe and fleshy, this wine is firm and dry, but has extra-ripe fruit. Perhaps the fruit is too rich, leaving the wine unbalanced. In the future, it will show fewer tannins and more fruit. Corinne and Charles-Henri Gonet of the Gonet Champagne family bought Bacalan with the intent of restructuring the vineyards, some of which had not been planted for 70 years. The first red vintage was 2001; first white vintage was 2014."
"This wine is full of tannins that are typical of the vintage. Although there are flavors of black currants, the wine is firm and still dry around the edges. It will soften while remaining tannic. Drink from 2017."
This wine is dry but rich enough with black-currant flavors to compensate. The juicy aftertaste suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2017. This wine is the latest result of renovations on the 15-generation and 400-year-old Trocard family estate.
"This wine is packed with tannins, less packed with fruit. That gives it a tough character, very dry and not fruity enough. The estate is owned by the Perrin family of Château Carbonnieux."
"This wine is lean, austere with high acidity that leaves fruit well behind. It is structured and dry, only hinting at black-currant freshness. This third-generation family estate also hosts monthly musical and tasting events and sells fruit, vegetables and honey."
"This wine is not balanced, with wood and acidity opposing each other. It has spice, high toast flavors and stalky black currants. Although it could have potential, it is likely to remain tough. The property is unusual-133 acres in one block."
"This unbalanced wine is caught between acidity and wood. It is hard to see how well this will develop. Owner Francis Boutemy, an inventor, created the ""Bout'mobile"" which glides seated pickers along rows as they cut clusters that are dropped directly into a mobile sorting machine."
"Wood aromas are repeated on the palate with a dry bitterness. This wine should soften as it develops, although that over-enthusiastic use of wood could remain. This is one of several Bordeaux estates owned by André Lurton."
"This wine is fresh with acidity, rather than fruit. The dry core shows up in wood flavors that still need to integrate with fruit. Give this wine a few years and it will come together while always being on the lean side. Drink from 2018."
"This wine is dry, dominated by the new-wood flavors and toasty character that hide any fruit. The lean structure will probably remain. The property is owned by the Kressmann family."
"With attractive acidity, this perfumed wine has a bright character and plenty of black-currant flavors. It's not a concentrated wine however it does have an attractive fruitiness. Bordeaux Sciences Agro school uses this 55-acre vineyard for training and experiments."
"This is a curiously juicy wine that is not fully integrated with the dry tannins. It has a hard-edged texture, a dry character that sits uneasily with the crisp black currant fruitiness."
"Very firm and closed up, this wine is a tough proposition at the moment. It has the weight to develop well along with richness. Acidity, sweet fruits and concentrated tannins will all come through strongly as the wine matures. Drink from 2020."
"This is closed up, dry and tough on the outside. But you can feel the rich weight and the dark tannins along with the powerful structure. That makes this wine both replete with a firm character and also full of generous, concentrated black fruits. It's a powerful wine, ready for good aging; drink from 2022."
"With smoky wood flavors allied to plenty of fruit, this is an attractive and structured wine. It has juicy berry fruits, plenty of acidity and a dark and dense core. It will age well, so drink from 2020."
"This wine is dry, full of tannins and dark fruits. It is weighty, structured and ready for the long term with its acidity, dry tannins, dense structure and intense black currant fruits. Drink this mineral-textured wine from 2020."
"This structured wine has juicy acidity as well as big, bold tannins. It's firm and concentrated, a powerful wine that's built for aging. Solid and dense rather than generous, this balanced wine needs many years. Drink from 2020."
New wood shows strongly in this wine that has structure and a dry core to match the ripe berry fruits and rich texture. The wine has potential with its juicy fruitiness and dark chocolate flavors. Wait until 2019 before drinking.
"This wine is rounded and very complete. Big berry and dark plum-skin flavors are balanced by the firm tannins and sweet vanilla from the wood aging. This is juicy, fresh and structured. It's likely to age well, so don't drink until 2020."
"One of the two second wines from Smith Haut Lafitte, this is distinguished by a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon. That gives the wine a great structure along with dark tannins and juicy black fruits. It comes from young vines on the estate, with a youthful exuberance that shows in the fruitiness of this wine. Drink from 2017."
"Solid layers of tannin partner with black currant fruit. This is structured, dark and very dry at the moment, although it will give a more rounded character as it ages. Drink from 2018."
"Vanilla new-wood aromas give a wine polished by its wood aging and dense tannins. Black plum fruits show strongly along with the toasty character. It's for serious aging, so don't drink this structured wine before 2022."
"This wine is smoky with sweet tannin and firmer wood flavors. It offers fresh, succulent fruitiness as well, with berry fruits that give fullness and density. Big and concentrated, this needs to age. Drink from 2019."
"Dry and structured, this dense wine has some austerity that comes from the dry tannins and extracted, bitter flavors. The aftertaste shows more of the tannins and dryness. Drink from 2020."
"While the tannins are very present in this wine, it also has good acidity and blackberry fruits. It's firm and structured in the front, still young, although allowing plenty of room for the fruit to show strongly over the next few years. Drink from 2019."
"A series of tannins washes over bright cherry fruits. The wine is all about berries and fresh acidity that are lightly textured. It finishes with acidity and a crisp, fruity aftertaste."
"Produced from young vines, this is the third wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. As such, it is very accessible with its ripe, red exuberant fruits. The tannins are in the background, giving the necessary structure to a wine that will age quickly. Drink from 2017."
"This is a dense, dry wine, full of concentrated tannins and somewhat hard-edged. While it does have acidity, it misses out on the fruitiness and ends up being tough and tannic."
"This wine is lean, more about structure than tannins. Some juicy fruitiness is overwhelmed by the dry core of the wine that seems over-extracted."
"With tight acidity and intense black currant fruits, this wine has a raw edge. It presents a full, fresh, crisp texture that's bright, with layers of acidity at the end."
"From one of the properties owned by André Lurton in Pessac-Léognan, this is a well-structured, wood-aged wine. Solid tannins and spice accompany coffee and bitter chocolate flavors. These are subsiding as the wine matures, leaving black currant fruits and a series of firm tannins that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2017."
"A small property owned by Château Carbonnieux, Haut-Vigneau has produced a serious while still fruity wine. Its spicy wood is attractive and gives a warm character to the cherry and red berry flavors. The wine will certainly age over the medium term, so drink from 2016."
"Big, fat and juicy, this wine has soft tannins and a full-bodied structure. It is full of the superripe Merlot that characterizes 2009, making the wine develop relatively quickly. It should be ready to drink by 2016."
"A new name from Léognan, this Château has produced a grand 2011. It has weight, richness and ripe berry fruits, underlaid with firm tannins and juicy acidity. It has a good future both from its fruit and its structure. Drink from 2018."
"This powerful, perfumed wine shows as much structure as fruit. That gives it a strong presence, solid and dense. Its black plum and damson fruits have richness, spice and intense acidity. With the dark tannins, the wine will certainly age. Drink from 2018."
"A powerful and rich wine, it features black plum fruits, sweet while solid tannins and a dense structure. With its fruitiness masked by the structure, it will need time to smooth out and show its ripe, full-bodied character. Drink from 2016."
"Made by the same team as Château de France in Pessac-Léognan, this is an attractive, forward wine. It shows the juicy character of the vintage, although the tannins do give it structure and some weight. A wine for medium-term aging: 4-5 years."
"Firm and tannic, this is a wine that offers good fruit along with its dark exterior. It has a smoky character, while the dark black fruit promises to give the wine a lift into the next 4-6 years."
"Produced at Château Haut-Bailly, this concentrated red show the attractive fruit of 2011. It's tannins are relatively gentle, a fine counter-point to the red berry and currant fruits. It's a wine for medium-term aging over the next 4-6 years."
"A powerful and complex wine from an estate performing on its top form. Solid tannins, layers of wood and dark fruits combine to give a wine that offers both richness and a dense structure. This Haut-Bailly should age impressively and for many years."
"A very structured, firm wine with excellent acidity and dark, dry tannins. The alcohol does show through, but the wine is firm and very dense, a big success from this Lurton family owned property."
"Now owned by Château Haut-Bailly, this wine was produced before the purchase. It is elegant and ripe; its tannins already well integrated, resulting in a full-bodied yet fruity character. Black plum and dark spice notes are lightened with refreshing acidity on the finish. Age for five years and more."
"Château Brown continues its impressive push to quality with this fine 2010. It brings demonstrates the structure of the year with its firm, youthful tannins. But it also shows plentiful black-currant flavor, layered with acidity. Classic and serious, this is a wine for aging."
"This has smooth, rich fruit, with sweet berries, ripe tannins and strong layers of wood. The wine is powerful; the stalky and bitter chocolate edge contrasts the sweet, ripe fruit. This is meant for long-term aging."
"Smooth and opulent, this immediately appeals with its generous fruit and texture that feels like velvet. The structure sits under the seductive surface, with a chocolate wood flavor, fruit tannins and density. Age for over 10 years at least."
"Dominating aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the toasty flavor that covers the fruit at this stage. But, like all 2009s, this is a rich wine that will balance out and show all of its opulence. That said, it will likely always be a firm, ageworthy wine, with the dark tannins always in evidence."
"Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year."
"Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit. Black fruits, coffee, very concentrated flavors, a powerhouse of structure and richness. The warmth of the wine is palpable, as is the aging potential."
"Rounded and sweet wine, its tannins buried in the rich blackberry fruits. It is dominated by its fruity character, although there is a chunky texture that gives a firm mouthfeel. Ready to drink in a year."

"91-93 Barrel sample. Firm tannins, solid chunky, but with good ripe fruits and sweet tannins. The wine has structure, some bitter coffee, and fresh acidity."
"A smooth, polished wine, with acidity, sweet fruit and a range of dusty tannins, with acidity. This is an accomplished, delicious wine that is developing fast, and seems only for medium-term aging."
"A wine that is dominated by wood at this stage in its development. But the structure and the fruit are all there, waiting to slot into place in the next 2-3 years. Spice and bright black berry flavors layer with final acidity."
"A dense wine, very much in the line of powerful wines from Haut-Bailly. Flavors of bitter chocolate, sweet berry fruits and richness are dominant, the acidity a fine balancing act to give a burst of freshness."
"A great success, with its concentration, solid tannins and black, bitter cherry fruit flavors. The wine has spice, licorice and some layers of wood. Certainly, this would be worth aging for 4-5 years."
"A smooth, velvet textured wine, piled high with sweet, ripe flavors. There is fine, opulent concentration here, impressive density, and a solid, tannic core. While it is not as powerful as some vintages from this estate, it certainly suggests the ability to age 5-6 years and more."
"A serious wine, filled with firm tannins, spiced with wood, and layered with bitter coffee as well as fruit. It certainly has power, the structure ready for long aging, firmly anchored in the dense character of this wine. It is a medium aging wine, 5-10 years."
"A wine on the lean side, relatively light, with tannins tight and firm. It has some initial easy berry flavors, but they are followed by a dry aftertaste."
"While it is not a powerful wine, it is elegant, balanced, with density of flavor and tannns, freshened by fruit acidity and red cherry and black currant fruits. Like many wines from 2007, this is for the medium term, and can even be drunk now."

It is a full while elegant wine, firm with its tannins and open with its ripe black fruits. It offers a lifted character, both from the acidity and from the clean aftertaste. Drink from 2024."
"Just on the edge of the urban sprawl of Bordeaux, this estate has managed to retain its vineyard despite the housing pressure. This year it is beautifully structured, dense and very stylish. Black-currant fruit, some firm tannins and balance make this wine so attractive. Drink from 2024."
"This selection from different parcels in the Latour-Martillac vineyard is released when the chateau believes it is ready to drink. This wine is showing attractive signs of maturity as well as some of the tannins that mark out this vintage. It will probably remain on the dry side, meaning it will always be a food wine. Drink now."
"The impressive second wine of Latour-Martillac, this is generous and ripe, full of black-currant fruit and balanced acidity. The soft texture makes the wine very accessible. It is likely to be ready to drink quickly, certainly by 2020."
"Owned by Sophie Lurton and her husband, Laurent Congombles, who also owns cru classé Château Bouscaut in the same appellation, this estate has produced a richly spicy wine, full of toasty flavors. The fruit is still developing behind this barrage of wood, but will come through as the wine matures. Drink from 2023."
"Hugely rich, the wine has a density that detracts from the natural elegance of this appellation. Its tannins and extracted fruit are firm although with the potential of juicy black-currant acidity as the wine progresses. Give this wine several years and don't drink before 2022."
"Full of black-currant flavor, this firm wine has structure and a rich texture. Its bolstering tannins and vibrant acidity mark out an age-worthy selection. Spice tones and a dry core set the stage for a slow development into an even more complex and fulfilling wine. Drink from 2025."

"A big, virile wine, dominated by dark and firm tannins. The structure comes from powerful black fruits, the wood only showing as dry edge to the tannins. It's firm, obviously destined for long aging, with initial blackberry fruits powering through the density. A stupendous wine that will last many decades."

Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections."
"It is the power that is so evident in this wine - a full, up-front expression of Merlot at its most powerful. It is somewhat closed up at this stage, but it is going to continue its development as an enormous wine which still manages to keep its power under firm control."
"This is a wonderful, dense wine, very concentrated, very intensely flavored. At this stage of its development, it is the opulence which is most evident, but there are already hints that it will show pure fruit alongside sweet tannins, and will develop complexity."
"This is likely to be one of the most long-lived Pomerol from 2000. It has hugely rich fruit, it is has great density. But what will give it its longevity is the layer of tannin that sits, brooding, in the middle of the wine. Don't even attempt to drink before 2012."
"Denis Durantou's obsessive search for perfection paid off handsomely with this stunning 2000. Despite the richness of the fruit, there is still a sense of lightness to the wine which makes it surprisingly easy to comprehend at this stage. The Cabernet Franc perfumes couterpoint the rich Merlot, while the wood underpins everything."
"While the first impression with Pétrus is the wood, it is the fruit which gradually shows itself. It is extraordinary, this dense fruit, which simultaneously manages to float with elegance. There is layer after layer of fruit, sometime black, sometimes smoky, sometimes spicy. The wine is not yet totally integrated, still intensely young, with decades to go. But what a development it will be"

"Close to 100% Merlot, this wine comes from the old vines of this small Pomerol estate. It is rich, still with its tannins intact, and offers a solid burst of ripe black fruits. The wine is still young, still with the first flush of fruitiness. Drink from 2020."
"The wine is a velvet glove in an iron fist. The smooth surface of ripe fruits and rich blackberry flavors, masks the dense tannins that will allow this very great wine to age for many, many years. The acidity and the rich fruit combine with the fine dusty tannins. The wine will surely not be ready to drink before 2027."
"This is a rich, finely structured wine. It is highly perfumed, packed with black fruits and has a dark, firm texture. At the same time, the acidity is intense and the structure tight, suggesting a wine to age. Beautifully endowed with great fruit, it will take time to develop. Drink from 2026."

"For a Pomerol, which would normally be almost entirely Merlot, this has a good amount of Cabernet Franc in the blend. The firm tannins and perfumed character of the Cabernet contrast with and balance the rich, jammy Merlot. It's still very young, so don't drink before 2023."
"While there are plenty of wood-aging flavors at this young stage of the wine, the weight of black fruits and generous texture promise a ripe future. The wine, with its 80% Merlot is juicy, full and packed with richness. Drink from 2022."
"Made from 80% Merlot, this wine is smooth and generously textured. The tannins are already embedded in the black fruits and juicy acidity. Spice from wood aging adds complexity. This is a wine for the medium-term. Drink from 2022."
"This is like drinking liquid black currants and blackberries. The wine has great intensity and richness from the superbly generous Merlot. The wood aging shows as a hint in the background, with the bold black fruit and ample acidity dominating. Drink from 2026."
"This wine is full of crisp fruit, perfumed wood and red-berry acidity. Perfumed Cabernet Franc gives extra complexity to the juicy Merlot to offer a balanced wine that will be ready from 2019"
"This 11-acre, family-owned property has produced a generous, opulent wine. A blend of 75% Merlot with Cabernet Franc, it shows the ripeness of the fruit in this vintage giving a rich, dark plum-flavored wine. Tannins lie at the core of this cushion of fruit. Still young, it needs time and will be best from 2020."
"The French often use the name Benjamin to indicate a youngest son, and this second wine from Château Beauregard exhibits all the youthful exuberance of a young wine. It doesn't have weight, but it does have balance and fresh acidity, given depth by wood."
"With its rich chocolate and spice flavors, this rolls around the mouth like velvet, its fruit so well-integrated with the wood and the vanilla that it is seamless. A delicious wine that deserves 3-4 years aging."
"Full and solid, here is a wine with denseness and rich, ripe Merlot flavors. Dried black fruits, eucalyptus and sweet berries all work together well. The tannins are dry, firm, a dark layer under the rich fruit. Worth aging for 2-3 years."
"It would almost be worth buying this wine for its mock-medieval label alone. But the wine is also worth it-rich, but firmly structured, a good density with some bitter chocolate to go with the black berry fruits and the dark tannins."
"For Merlot from Pomerol, this wine has a surprising austerity to it. The tannins are initially dominant, with their leather character. But then, the layer of sweet juiciness does shine through, giving freshness and some vibrant flavors. It needs time to knit together though-give it at least four years."
"A wonderfully firm wine, which balances extraction with pure sweet fruit. It moves comfortably within its tannic structure, the ripe Merlot allowed plenty of play to show off its black jelly and plum flavors."
"A wine that certainly has excellent balance despite the wood that dominates the aromas. The flavors are dry, with tannins as the strongest element. What's underneath the fruit is still waiting to show through."
"Everything is here in this great wine. The solid fruit flavors are of black berries and dried raisins, and there is a rich, powerful structure. Above all, it is finely balanced. It shows that a wine can be powerful without being high alcohol."
"Certainly it is firm, with impressive power. But the smoothness of the ripe black fruits as they combine with the beautifully judged wood show a contrast of tension with the dense, chewy core. At its heart, this wine is dark and solid and concentrated, promising long aging."
"As so often, Pétrus has the ability to charm and impress, to seduce and overwhelm. This 2005, one of the greatest vintages from this great chateau, is massive and concentrated, with flavors of ripe black figs, chocolate and dark plums. Put that all together and the result is the utmost deliciousness, freshness and elegance. A major wine. Imported by Etablissements Jean-Pierre Moueix."
"Rich, yet firmly structured, this wine comes from Christian Moeuix's home territory. It's no surprise then that it is a great expression of the appellation, a full expression of ripe Merlot, truffles, fruitcake, generous tannins and a tobacco-scented finish."
"A dark, dense wine, still very young, but already supple. Merlot was ripe in 2004 and this wine shows it in its opulence and richness. Yet there are tannins here, so drink now, and age over the next 5 years. A great value for a Pomerol."
"A wine with a great weight of fruit. While there is a good amount of new wood, the ripeness and density of the Merlot copes with the toast well. The tannins, dry as they are, show plenty of richness supporting a great well of fruits."
"This has pure, black currant fruit aromas and flavors, and wood and acidity on the palate. It is packed with fresh, vibrant fruit. Imported by William Grant & Sons."
"This is a simple, tank-aged wine, without any pretensions to complexity. But it has full, red fruit and licorice flavors, plus good tannins. For the difficult 2002 vintage, this is a good wine. Imported by William Grant & Sons."
A very youthful wine that needs time. It has coffee bean aromas and accents of wood and black currants. Needs time for the acidity to develop and soften. Give it 4-5 years. Imported by William Grant & Sons.
"For a solid mouthful of Merlot at a great price, there's no need to look further. Spicy blackberry and toast aromas add vanilla on the palate, before finishing with soft, ripe tannins and leathery notes. Drink now-2008. Editors' Choice."
"Satisfyingly ripe wine, now approaching maturity. It has just the right weight from the black currant fruits, the more mature leather texture and the firm tannins that give a dry core. The wine could age for several more years, but is ready to drink now."
"Modern style of wine, with hints of polished wood, mint flavors and a strong sense of structure. Along with the blackberry fruit, still showing no signs of age, the wine has concentration and elegance. It's a wine for more aging over another 4-5 years."
"It's rare to find a 10-year old Bordeaux just arrived in this country. This now mature wine is full and rich, its weight coming from spice and textured tannins that are laced with acidity. It is initially dry, but does open out to give a juicy, if mature, character but is unlikely to age."
"Soft wine, dominated by wood spice and tannins. It has weight, which suggests the juicy fruit will show through after a year. Age for 3-4 years."
"Plenty of dense texture here, derived from a liberal use of wood. That gives spice to the black berry fruit and bitter chocolate extract. In two years, this will be showing well."

"Very smooth and soft, this is an interpretation of Bordeaux that left out the tannins. But the pleasure in this easy, ripe wine is there, the blackberry fruit rich and right up front."
"Big fruited wine, its wood element just a support for the ripe black berry and cranberry flavors. The tannins are a big element here, firm and very dry, but with the fruit freshness, the wine is ready to drink."
"A wine that still shows some youthful tannins, but is maturing well, its freshness subsumed into the red plum and jelly flavors. It is ready to drink now, but should be decanted."
"A spicy wine, all new wood with plenty of toast. The fruit, however, is rich enough to cope, giving a mouthfilling wine, dense and sweetly tannic with a firm, ripe finish. Age this wine for another year."
"A firm, ripe wine, with good sweet black currant fruit flavors. It is structured, but mainly showing fruit rather than tannins. There is a fine, fresh finish, hinting at wood."
"Smooth, rounded, with an obvious layer of wood to soften the red fruits and dry tannins. This is a balanced wine, offering some good juicy fruits and a bright red berry finish."
"A Merlot-dominated wine from the east bank of the Gironde estuary. It's big, possibly too powerful, with meaty, smoky flavors and spice. Solid, chunky, it gives freshness and liveliness right at the end, as the acidity comes through."
"Using the ripeness of 2003 and adding to it by high extraction, the wine has moved from Bordeaux to New World. The fruit, which certainly has some attractive blackberry jelly flavors, has been overoaked, giving power and intensity."
"A dense, solid wine, still showing young fruit flavors, but with the toast from the wood aging there is a touch of burnt wood and spice. There's great acidity, fresh black currant flavors and some smokiness."
"A well-balanced, structured wine, produced from five acres owned by actor Gérard Depardieu. The tannins are solid, the fruit is black-hued, flavored with figs and plums, but leavened with delicious ripeness, acidity and balance."
"Remember that old TV commercial asking, ""Where's the beef?"" You can apply that here. It smells fresh enough, and there's cranberry-styled tart fruit backed up by oak. But it's way short on soul and stuffing. No need to hold this; drink it now for what fruit there is. Made from 75% Merlot."
A thin wine that is all dry tannins and not enough fruit. It is lightweight with just a hint of juiciness.

"Ripe, smooth, rich fruits, juicy strawberry flavor and fresh acidity. The texture is solid and dense, with an obvious potential for aging."

"High toast and burnt wood are initially off-putting. The tannins in the wine are also on the smoky side. However, there is fruit here, offering some balance in this powerful, dry wine, and giving some blackberry juiciness, which gives relief from the intensity of the wood."
"Under the ownership of American Stephen Adams, this estate is showing promise. The wine is finely structured, a smoky bacon element mingling well with fresh red plum and firm tannins. The core is dry, solid, showing wood, finishing with vivid minerality and acidity."

"A small property bought by Jean-Louis Trocard in 1995. This 2004 is dominated, perhaps too much, by new wood. It is difficult to taste the fruit through the wood, and it tastes too light for the amount of wood present. It could come around, but for now, it is for those who like toast and vanilla flavors."
"A branded Saint-Emilion from the local cooperative, one of the best in Bordeaux. The label is designed to please-bright yellow with a smiling face, so different from the average Bordeaux label. And the wine is also designed to be a crowd puller-soft, open Merlot with very ripe tannins and richness rather than dryness."
"If not the best, then one of the best kosher wines we've ever tasted, with smoke, cedar and meat aromas nicely balanced by plummy, chocolaty fruit. A creamy mouthfeel and smooth, easy finish makes it a delight to drink, but consume this Merlot-based wine over the near term. Imported by Royal Wine Corporation."
"A slight step down from the nonmevushal bottling, with less plumpness on the midpalate and slightly roasted, but similar, flavors of chocolate, mocha, cedar and bacon. Supple on the finish, this is a blend of 70% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc. Imported by Royal Wine Corporation."



"Shows a fair amount of toasty, vanilla-scented oak, but its well balanced by cassis and tobacco notes. Medium-to-full-bodied, with a supple mouthfeel and dusty earth and tobacco flavors. Ripe cherry fruit comes through on the finish, suggesting that better things may emerge in another couple of years."
"The quality of Faugéres continues to be impressive, none more so than in lesser vintages. This 2002, with its fine structure, balancing tannins, fruit and acidity is dry but has layers of tarry black fruit flavors, leaving a great, fresh, lifted taste in the mouth."
"Gems like this from the stellar 2000 vintage are still available to consumers willing to explore lesser-known chateaus. Concentrated scents of black cherries and cassis emerge from the glass, followed by admirably pure flavors of black cherries and vanilla. It's supple enough to drink now, but appears to have the stuffing to go another 5-10 years. A long, berry-filled finish caps off this find."
"Already showing some bricking at the rim, this St.-Emilion from the owner of Château Pavie is altogether different from that storied wine. Starts with scents of raisins, smoke and leather, and continues in that vein on the palate, where the flavors run toward dried fruit and vanilla. Supple, soft tannins on the finish suggest early drinkability."
"The wine is rich and ripe, revealing purity of fruit as well as prominent new wood flavors. Otto Rettenmaier, whose cellar is full of wooden cuves named after opera stars, now operates in a biodynamic way and that seems to give an intensity of flavor as well as lusciousness and opulence. Drink from 2010."
"Corinne Guisez scored a great success with her 2000. The wine is finely polished, shining, with its generous, deeply concentrated fruits and fine perfumes. The tannins show through the fruit, while the wood flavors hide much more discreetly in the background."
"A modern, smooth wine, with polished fruit and a dark purple color. The wine is full of new wood, but still dominated by liquorice and dark chocolate flavors. It should develop relatively quickly, over the next 10 years."
"The Becots, Gérard and Dominique, have produced a stylish, modern wine that powers black, sweet fruits through the deceptively soft tannins. Tarry flavors and layers of new wood give the wine a new world character. How long it will last is open to question at this stage. It is certainly developing quickly."
"A soft, rich wine that bears all the classic qualities of the Valette family's winery - a strength of line along and complexity. The fruit is ripe, ultra-generous, but is still tempered with layers of acidity and soft tannins."
"Under the regime of Gérard Perse, Pavie seems to have become more opulent, more extracted, and, dare I say it, more simplistic. The richness of the 2000 vintage lends itself to this technique. While it is a wonderful, immediately appealing wine, with its intense dark fruits, it seem to lack the complexity of other wines of similar status."
"This is the flagship wine from the mini-empire (now comprising five properties) that is controlled by Comte Stephan von Niepperg. He has made a modern, wood dominated wine, with rich, concentrated black fruits. It is powerful, perhaps too powerful, lacking a sense of the usual grace of this estate, although the ripeness of the wine does compensate."
"This Moueix-owned premier grand cru classé property quietly goes about producing great wines. The 2000 is a complete success, with its aromas of red berry fruits and sweet wood, its flavors cedar and truffles alongside the fine, elegant tannins. It will age slowly and reveal layers of complexity over the years."
"Opulence and richness, with all the generosity of Merlot, are the hallmarks of this superb wine. It is huge and powerful and has enormous potential. What is so exceptional about this wine is that all its power is still to be revealed. In 10 years time, it will prove to be one of the stars of the vintage in Saint-Emilion."
"This wine is superb. With its power and structure it will age over 20 years or more. Backed by blackcurrant and jelly flavors, it shows great fruity attractiveness even at this early stage in its development. It will develop slowly and evenly to become a reference point for the vintage."
"In 2000, it seems the Cabernet Franc made Cheval Blanc. It has given a mysterious, wonderful perfume to the intense richness of the Merlot. It has less of the explosive power of Ausone, it is more subtle and elegant, reserving its explosion of richness for the end, when a welter of black fruits seems to go on for ever"
"Forget all those garage wines, forget the upstarts of Saint-Emilion. When you want real class, you have to turn to Ausone. What a wine - magnificently dense and opaque, hugely rich and sensual. Yet it doesn't seem in the least decadent - for deep inside the wine is a huge backbone of ripe tannins. Keep for at least 10 years"
"A surprisingly lean style, with bell pepper aromas and green pepper flavors. There is certainly fruit, and a tannic structure, but the wine seems too lightweight for a 2000 and for this property is a disappointment."
"There is plenty of fine fruit in this wine. It has fresh, lively blackcurrant flavors as well as generous, soft, sweet tannins. It seems rather one-dimensional at this stage, leaving a question-mark over its development."
"This is Gérard Perse's home, and he has done wonders for a vineyard on the sandy plain of Saint-Emilion. With 2000, the property has shone, producing a serious, complex wine that boasts black fruits and solid tannins. The acidity and wood flavors give it shape and leave a delicious, lingering taste."
"This chateau shows continual improvement, and 2000 is a triumph. The wine is in a modern style, although at this stage its tannins are still firm and dry. Red fruit flavors and blackcurrants promise huge drinking pleasure to come."
"This was the last vintage at Clos Fourtet under the ownership of the Lurtons. They made fine wine, but the potential of the property was never quite realized. The wine just fails to excite: it is rich and concentrated with ripe tannins and some sweetness, but at the same time, there is a layer of acidity and structure which gives the wine a firm, solid shape."
"François Despagne has certainly pulled this property together after it lost Grand Cru Classé status in 1996. The 2000 shows real class and style. It has plenty of new wood flavors, but they are well judged and have been used to support the solid fruit and black tannins. It is developing fast, but the tannins are there to allow it to age."
"An elegant grand cru whose tannic structure is just beginning to resolve. Has a nose of berry aromas, earthy accents and even meaty notes. The palate displays developed ripe cassis and earth flavors. Still youthful, it drinks well, but should evolve further over the next few years."
"From a vintage known for its readily-approachable wines, this grand cru Saint-Emilion shows surprising structure. Some toasty oak frames delicate black-cherry fruit. Black tea notes on the finish carry more tannins than the fruit can handle in the long run, so catch this one soon before it heads south."
"Dark earth and tobacco spice the aromas of this grand cru, followed by flavors of black cherries and herbs. The Cabernet Franc portion shines clearly through as a distinctive weediness, but it's somewhat balanced by roasted black cherries and only a hint of espresso-like oak."
"A solid claret, with cherry and plum fruit accented by dried herbs and a touch of vanilla. This is a basic Saint-Emilion that stays true to its appellation and doesn't try to be more than it is: a user-friendly wine that goes down easy."
"Displays handsome aromas and flavors with a complex mix of plummy fruit, earth, mushrooms, violets and lavender, and dusty cocoa. Attractive balance with good body and texture. Blackberry and coffee flavors mark the finish, which sports full but well-dispersed tannins. Appealing now, but has some aging potential, too. Accessible, affordable, appellation-bearing Bordeaux. Best Buy."
"The second wine of this Premier Grand Cru Classé estate is very fine. With its rich tannins, generous acidity and black fruits, it is solid and dense while having such attractive fruitiness. The wine will age well, full of ripe fruit and with excellent concentration. Drink from 2021."
"Owned by négociant firm Antoine Moueix, this property on the plateau of Saint-Emilion, has produced a ripe and balanced vintage in 2014. The oak aging has enhanced the richness of the wine with its balanced tannins and black-currant fruits. It will age well and be ready to drink from 2021."
The Bordeaux outpost of the Jackson family winery has produced a rich wine in this vintage. It is structured with swathes of ripe black fruits. The tannins promise some serious aging for this complex ripe wine with its solid texture. Drink from 2023.
"This 10-acre estate dates from the 16th century. Today, it has produced a solidly structured wine with firm tannins and a dense textured character. The black fruits are firm with considerable intensity and backed with spice and acidity. Drink from 2021."
"The wine comes from a tiny seven-acre estate to the east of the town of Saint-Emilion. Owned by the same family since 1847, it estate is making serious wine. This is a rich wine, perfumed by Cabernet Franc although firmly based in Merlot. Black plum and berries are strengthened by the firm tannins that will allow further aging. Drink from 2018."
"Still with intense tannins, this Merlot-dominated blend is young. The fruitiness is all there with ripe smoky fruit and blackberry flavors. It just needs a while for the tannins to soften into ripe generous fruitiness. Drink from 2020."
"The rich fruit and structure of this impressive wine are already well integrated. With power and concentration as well as layers of dark fruits, it is showing fine aging potential. The wine, dominated by 80% Merlot, comes from vines in the east of Saint-Emilion. Drink from 2020."
"From a Grand Cru estate, this second wine shows the same rich fruit and generous structure as the winery's first wine. It's just softer with an approachable character and generous black fruits that will enable it to mature relatively quickly. Drink from 2020."
"The Figeac sector of Saint-Emilion has many estates that split off in the 19th century from a grand Château Figeac estate. This Moreaud family wine is smooth, with the fruitiness typical of the vintage and with a gentle layer of tannins to hold it all together. It will age quickly and should be ready to drink from 2019."
"The wine, with its juicy red fruits, has fine acidity as well as a core that has a dry tannin and mineral texture. It is structured and firm with the fruit still developing. Drink from 2020."
"Grown on the flat plain beneath the ridge of Saint-Émilion, this wine comes from light sand and gravel soil. That is reflected in the balance of the wine. Its firm tannins are comfortably embedded in the ripe berry fruits and the wine will soon be ready to drink. Just wait until the end of 2017."
"This producer, based in the eastern edge of Saint-Emilion, has these vines in the flat plain that leads to the Dordogne river. The wine has richness that comes from the vintage while also having structure and power. The juicy acidity and blackberry fruits are still developing, so drink from 2019."
"This is a structured wine, juicy with black-currant fruit and acidity. It will develop quickly, softening its tannins and filling out with ripe fruit. Drink from 2018."
"Effectively half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is a tremendous wine. With very fine tannins, spice from a touch of wood and swathes of ripe fruits give this wine its concentration and its huge potential. The wine has weight and a dark, dense structure that will allow it to age for many years. Drink from 2027."
"This powerful ripe wine has firm tannins that are so well integrated. With acidity and with rich black fruit, the wine is concentrated and dense. From a small parcel on the slope of Saint-Emilion, it is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2026."
"With the amalgamation of Château Magdelaine into this one property, the estate is now a considerable 58 acres. The wine is now performing in top gear. Powerful tannins drive the mainly Merlot blend with 10% Cabernet Franc. It still shows signs of the wood aging and these will disappear to leave a richly endowed wine with a fine future. Drink from 2026."
"Here's an impressive wine that is so ripe and with great structure. It is a major wine with a dark complex texture and the finest acidity. The wine is very complete, all the elements in place from the black fruits to the tannins to the hints of wood aging. Now at the top of the tree in Saint-Emilion's classification, the wine will take years to mature. Drink from 2027."
"This almost 100% Cabernet Franc single-vineyard wine is perfumed and ripe. The velvet tannins and ripe black fruits are fine, structured and with enormous potential. The wine is generous, opulent and worthy of serious aging. Drink from 2027."
"With its high proportion of Cabernet Franc (45%), this is a finely perfumed rich wine. It has great tannins, a smoky character that comes from the wood. The tannins are quite marked, giving a tight firm edge to the wine that otherwise has generous fruitiness. This is a complex wine, impressive, and likely to age over many years. Drink from 2028."
The classic blend for Figeac with its 32% of Cabernet Sauvignon and 28% Cabernet Franc gives a beautifully dense wine with great tannins. The wine is perfumed while the complex tannins are finely cushioned by the generous black fruits and acidity. It is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2026.
"This grand wine is stylish and elegant. It is also powerful and dense with dark tannins and great concentration. It is a very fine wine, packed with black plum and berry fruits and balanced richness. Don't let the great fruit deceive: this is a wine for the serious long term. Drink from 2028."
"Rounded and rich, this single-vineyard wine is concentrated without losing a touch of its beautiful fruit. It has a fine balance between fruit and acidity as well as a tense line of minerality and tight texture. Drink this impressive wine from 2024."
"Produced from biodynamically grown grapes, this is a fine, smooth and rich wine. Great tannins are cushioned within the ripe blackberry fruits and generous texture. It is already a delicious wine, although certain to age as well. The estate is close to Château Figeac. Drink from 2022."
"This rich wine has a good proportion (31%) of Cabernet Franc to give it a perfumed structured character. It is dense and with considerable tannins at this stage. By contrast, the fruit has enormous potential with rich blackberry and black-plum flavors. This chateau has made a considerable stride in this vintage. Drink from 2022."
"Tight and concentrated, this is a very fine wine. Great acidity and great tannins go with the most intense fruit. Blackberry and black-cherry flavors power through this structured wine. There is also elegance and a fine sense of style. Drink from 2025."
"From the vineyard on the slope above Château Pavie, this is a beautiful, juicy and ripe wine. It has a mineral character with great swathes of black-currant fruit. This is a very fine wine, well delineated, ripe and with a delicious red-currant aftertaste. Drink from 2026."
"This is a deliciously balanced wine. Spice from the wood aging makes a happy contrast with the black-currant fruit and acidity. It is elegant and with great fruitiness. The wine, with its tannic base, will age well. The estate is to the west of Saint-Emilion, close to Château Figeac. Drink from 2023."
"Ripe and fruity with smooth tannins and generous fruits, this is a concentrated wine that is also stylish. It has plenty of tannins that are so well integrated. The wine is going to be delicious with its acidity and juicy jammy fruit. Drink from 2020."
"This is a generous ripe wine. It is full of rich black fruits that are cut with acidity as well as fleshed out with firm tannins. Dense and still dry, this young wine needs to age further. Drink from 2021."
"With great acidity, this wine that comes from vines close to Château Pavie, is ripe with fine tannins and a generous structure. It is fruity with red-berry fruits and a crisp texture. The wine, with its tannins, will take time to develop. Drink from 2022."
"The wine from this estate, controlled by Jean-Luc Thunevin of Château Valandraud, is serious with dark tannins and concentrated fruit. It is complex with layers of black fruit and a sweet ripe structure. Serious, intense and with fine acidity as a balance, it will be ready from 2023."
"Ripe Merlot gives this wine its richness and concentration. It is filled with black fruits, hints of the wood aging and with tannins cushioned by the fruit. Acidity shows strongly at the end, leaving a bright aftertaste. Drink from 2020."
"This is the second wine of Château de Pressac, situated to the east of the town of Saint-Emilion. With ripe black-plum fruit and finely integrated sophisticated tannins, this is a rich wine that wears its alcohol easily. The juicy acidity at the end keeps the wine crisp and fruity. Drink from 2022."
"The wine is tight with tannins and a dense texture. It has plenty of fruit underneath to allow this blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot to balance out. Perfumed and with fine acidity, the wine should be ready from 2019."

"Produced at one of the group of chateaus owned by the Ducourt family, this wine is bright, fruity and with a light tannic touch. It has a fine balance between its black fruits and its structure which will let it age well. Drink from 2022."
Ripe berry fruits give this wine its richness. There is a strong acidity as well that cuts through the wine leaving a stalky tight young fruitiness. Let the wine soften and drink from 2020.
"The third wine of Château Valandraud, this is a lighter version of the estate. With its generous tannins and concentration, it is smoky, full of blackberry fruits and the potential to age for a few years. Drink from 2020."
"Considering the relatively light nature of the vintage, this wine has been overmanipulated. Hard tannins and a bitter chocolate flavor are all too much for the fruit. A gentler approach would have been better."
"A ripe bold wine with generous black fruits, it is a blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. Dark and concentrated, it brings together rich fruitiness and firm tannins that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018. The wine comes from a vineyard that is currently in biodynamic conversion."
"Produced from organically grown grapes, the wine is rich and structured. It comes from an estate that has never seen pesticides or artificial fertilizers (the previous owner was 104 years old when she died and never used them). It is a full of blackberry fruits, rich with tannins and firm with a dark core of dryness. Drink this wine from 2020."
"This rich barrel-aged wine is a blend of 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It is a small, seven-acre estate just outside the village of Saint-Émilion. There are touches of licorice in this wine, hinting at extraction that needs to calm down. When that happens, this will be a dense and finely perfumed wine, rich and with a good future. Drink from 2022."
"This is the second wine from one of the group of chateaus with Corbin in their names. It is a tight wine, firm with tannins and with a concentrated texture and flavors of over-extraction. That said, the wine will probably develop over time into something serious with a dark, dense aftertaste."
"The second wine of Château Dassault in Saint-Émilion is rich and fruity, bringing out the ripe fruit of the vintage. The tannins, already well integrated, give the wine a firm core that is surrounded by juicy blackberry flavors and final acidity. Developing well, the wine should be ready from 2018."
"Dominated by its 72% Merlot, this wine is soft, ripe and with the smoothness that comes from barrel aging. It is rich, with concentration and generous fruit typical of the vintage. From vines close to the Dordogne river, it is a juicy wine that will develop quickly. Drink from 2018."

"A rich, while also juicy wine, this is a packed with black-currant fruits and delicious acidity. Soft tannins and toasty spice from the wood aging add extra interest to this fruity ripe wine. The 11-acre property is farmed organically. Drink from 2018."
"This is the second wine of Laroze, a property situated on the plateau to the west of Saint-Émilion. This is a softly ripe and perfumed wine with 40% Cabernet Franc in the blend. It is rich, smooth and dense with black fruits and balanced acidity. Drink from 2018."
"The tannins of this firm wine are softening well to give richness as well as structure. With juicy black currants, it is going to be a solid, dense wine. This is the second wine of the family-owned Grand Pontent which is managed by a member of the Bécot family of classed growth Beauséjour-Bécot. Drink from 2018."
"Strongly dominated by its wood aging, this is a toasty, licorice and dark-coffee-flavored wine. It does have some black-fruit weight that should allow the wine to balance out. So wait until at least 2019 before drinking."
"Still full of tannins, this is a tight strongly textured wine. It is dry, just hinting at black fruits and juicy acidity. It is probably already aged and so will remain a firm wine with fruit flavors in the background."
This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.
"This ripe Saint-Émilion is generous with its rounded perfumed Merlot. It gives the wine richness, juicy acidity and an open texture. Touches of tannin do bring in some structure, but the emphasis is on the fruitiness and fresh aftertaste. Drink from late 2017."
"The second wine of this Saint-Emilion Premier Grand Cru Classé estate comes from selected parcels. Rich and with the smoothness of oak aging and ripe grapes, it is a generous wine that is developing well. Drink from 2020."
"With vineyards to the east of Saint-Émilion itself, this chateau has produced a structured, obviously wood-aged wine. It's a wine still in development, bursting with young black-currant and black-plum fruits as well as acidity. The wood is a strong background presence and will soften over the next few years. Drink from 2020."
"There is a heavy wood presence in this wine. For now, it dominates with burnt toast and dark chocolate flavors. Happily, the fruit is also developing well, bringing its fresh black-currant flavors into the balance. Drink this still-young wine from 2020."
"This is a firm wine with solid tannins as well as layers of juicy black currant and cherry fruits. Acidity and a good sense of structure are still developing, meaning the wine needs to age longer. Drink from 2018."
"The wine shows the firm tannins of the vintage. They give a dry core that will probably remain. However, there is also a fine layer of fresh black-currant fruit that gives a fine lift to the wine at the end. It will be ready soon, drink from 2017."
"This is a ripe, fruity wine that comes from river plain vineyards of Saint-Emilion. It has rich tannins and juicy blackberry and black-plum fruits. The structure is comfortably cushioned in the generous texture. Drink this wine from 2017."
"This is a fruity wine with contrasting wood-aging spice and high toastiness. It is still young with the acidity still prominent, so the two elements should blend well over the next few years to give a ripe, fruity wine. Drink from 2018."
"With 90% Merlot, this is a full supple wine from the eastern end of Saint-Emilion. There are tannins that support the perfumed blackberry fruit and the balanced acidity. The wine is ready to drink now, although it will be better from 2017."
The 30-year-old vines of this estate surround a 16th-century castle. The wine is ripe although with intense acidity at the end. Wood aging has added spice and has smoothed out the bright acidity and red-berry fruits. Drink from 2019.
"As its color indicates, the wine is approaching maturity. It has a rich texture with red fruits, some firm tannins and a generous character. With its spice, ripeness and concentration, it is fine to drink now, although the wine does fade quickly after opening."
"This small production wine is the equivalent of a second wine for Count Leo de Malet-Roquefort's Premier Grand Cru Classé estate. The wine is smooth, elegant and ripe. Black plums and perfumed acidity are accompanied by some wood aging flavors and fresher black-currant fruitiness. It is a sophisticated wine that still needs to age. Drink from 2019."
"This is a structured wine that shows class and finesse. It has rich juicy blackberry flavors that are supported by some firm tannins and a dense texture. The wine is ready to drink for its fruitiness, although it will be better from 2019."
"With a dominance of Merlot in the blend, this Saint-Émilion-classed growth has ripe, jammy fruits and softening tannins. It is dense and concentrated with big blackberry fruits that have a touch of spice and pepper from the alcohol. The wine is rich and ready to drink now and until 2024."
"This is a rich, smoke and tannin-filled wine. Still young, the black-plum fruits are in the background, suggesting ripe juiciness for the future. Produced from vines on the east end of the plateau of Saint-Émilion, it is full bodied and will develop well. Drink from 2018."
"Visitors to Saint-Émilion will see the winery of Clos des Menuts right in the town center. The vines, on the plateau outside, have produced a ripe wine in the 2012 vintage. It's rich and soft, still with juicy black fruits and a smoky mildly tannic character. This will develop as a ripe wine to drink from 2018."
"With vines to the east of Saint-Émilion, this family-owned vineyard has produced a ripe, smooth wine that is powerful and densely tannic. It is full of black plum flavors, a dark structure and hints of the wood aging. Drink from 2018."
"Still very young, this is a structured, firm wine that's dominated by juicy Merlot. The tannins are solid and dense although the juicy acidity is coming through along with the black-currant fruitiness. The wine will develop well, drink from 2019."
"A vineyard on the river plain of Saint-Émilion, Haut-Pezat has produced a wine whose full black fruits handle strong wood-aging flavors with ease. The result is a ripe wine packed with blackberry flavors and acidity that is filled out with the wood spice. The wine should age well, drink from 2020."
"Produced from 60-acres of vines on the plateau east of Saint-Émilion village, this is a fresh and fruity wine. It has layers of tannin surmounted with red cherry and black-currant fruits. The wine, with its dominance of Merlot, is developing well and will be ready to drink from 2018."
"Hugely dense and dark, the wine is over the top in all respects. From the heavy bottle to the much too concentrated fruit and wood flavors, it is a statement wine. Its saving grace is the quality of the vintage that inevitably has produced a wine that will balance out the tannins as it matures. Drink from 2019."
"Dominated by its 86% Merlot, this is a fruity wine that is surprisingly light for the vintage. It comes from the plain between Saint-Émilion and the Dordogne River, giving a soft style with just a touch of tannin. Drink from 2017."
"The wine suffers from heavy extraction that has left wood rather than fruit. Somewhere in there, the black-currant fruit and acidity are struggling. It will soften, although that wood will remain a problem."
"Tight, textured and mineral, this wine just hints at the fruit to come. It is dark, brooding and concentrated, with black-plum flavors just beginning to shine through the dry texture. It needs aging, so drink from 2022."
"Sophisticated and full of fruit, this wine combines the freshness of the year with great tension and structure. The juicy underlay will develop well over the next few years. It's complex and worth aging. Drink from 2024."
"Initially closed, this wine just hints at its richness and perfumed character. As it opens it shows still-young tannins and intense black plums and blueberries that will develop as the wine ages. It is likely to mature well over the medium to long term, and will not be ready to drink before 2022."
"With ripe, spicy fruit, this is a concentrated, dense wine. It has young, firm tannins that are beginning to integrate with the juicy black fruits and fine, perfumed acidity. This is a serious wine, showing how well this estate is developing even in a difficult year. Drink this from 2022."
"This wine is rich with jammy fruits and ripe acidity. Firm tannins are only just making a mark on the sweet, fleshy fruitiness. It revels in its concentrated fruit and in the dark tannins that are still at the back. This wine will certainly age, dense while always fresh and juicy at the end. Drink from 2022."
"Smoky aromas and layers of tannin and fruit give this wine great complexity. It is smooth, juicy and fresh while also having perfumed tannins and an elegant, lightly mineral structure from the Cabernet Franc. The wine's cherries and red berries are still encased in the structure, allowing it to develop slowly. Drink from 2024."
"Showing how Saint-Émilion came out well in 2013, this wine has ripe and juicy Merlot fruits topped with perfumed Cabernet Franc. Rich and structured, it's a wine for aging over the medium-term with its layers of tannins under the fruit. Drink from 2020."
"In this wine, the structure is supported by ripe fruits that push forward through the dense tannins. Spice and wood flavors will both integrate as it develops. The black-currant fruit at the end holds good promise for the future. Drink from 2022."
"From vines in the eastern section of Saint-Émilion, the Beaumartin family has produced a firmly structured wine that has both fruit and firm tannins. At this stage, the tannins dominate, giving the wine a dry character, but the juicy black-currant fruit is all there. Drink from 2018."
"Dating to the Middle Ages, this estate has produced a Merlot-dominated wine packed with dark tannins and a dusty texture that is becoming more elegant as it ages. The wine is still young and full of its concentrated structure. Drink from 2020."
"Ripe and powerfully structured, this is dense with bold blackberry flavors and dark tannins that give a firm structure. However, as so often with 2013, it's the fruit that shines in this rich wine. Drink from 2018."
"This is the second wine from Premier Grand Cru Classé estate La Gaffeliére, made from a selection of vines and barrels. It is rich and very ripe with bold black-fruit flavors and a dark, firm structure. The wine is already in balance, showing that it will develop quickly and attractively. Drink from 2018."
"This Grand Cru Classé, with its 25% Cabernet Franc, is rich and opulently textured. It brims with ripe berry fruits, plus dense tannins that are supple and well integrated. Still developing, it's full in the mouth and is becoming a generous wine, more fruit than long-term structure. Drink from 2017."
"Dark in color, this wine is firm, structured and dense. Ripe blackberry fruits dominate the tannins, giving weight and impressive richness for the vintage. The wood-aging is still showing in the dry core, so the wine needs to age. Drink from 2018."

"A smooth-textured wine that shows some ripe Merlot, firm fruit tannins and soft spice. There is an edge of wood, but the fruit is bright enough to cope. It should develop well into a rich wine."
"Dark in color, with an initial note of extraction, and with weighty fruit under the toasty surface. The wine is still coming together, needing 5-6 years to turn into the full-bodied ripe-fruited wine that it potentially is."
"A powerful, solid wine, its dark fruits fitting well with the wood, the firm tannins and black plum flavors. This is made for aging, as it is just starting to show its depth."
"Big and firm, the tannins dark and dominant, this is a wine in transition from fruity to mature. The structure, spice, dried fruits and chocolate is emerging at the moment. Give it 2-3 years for its impressive character to open."
"Soft and full in the mouth, with spice adding an extra dimension to the broad berry fruits. The wine is ready to drink, its acidity melding well into the richness. The final taste is solid and dense."
"The second wine of Château Fonplégade is fresh and bright with good fruits, berry flavors and some richness. It has good poise; ready to drink in 2-3 years."
"Firmly structured, this is a significant improvement on 2007, with the wood kept in play but not dominant. That's because the fruit is so bright, with juicy berries bubbling along, leaving refreshing acidity at the end."
"Dark in color, with a series of herbal aromas, this is dense and rich, with fine layers of berry fruits and solid tannins. It has a definite fresh character, with juicy fruit and acidity playing against the dry texture."
"A fresh, lightweight wine with good black berry fruits, a juicy character and balancing spice. The tannins are certainly dry, but the fruit is well in balance."
"Stalky in character, this has black currant fruits on a lean structure. The wood is not yet fully integrated and the wine could well flesh out in a couple of years."
Heavy bottles and heavy extract seem to go together; proving the point is this wine. Heavy toast dominates the berry fruit. The normal wine from Cheval Noir is much more attractive.
"A highly perfumed wine, with enticing aromas. The palate is tougher, unforgiving, the young structure there to support fresh and concentrated fruit. There is a definite wood element, but it is not overdone. For aging 3-4 years."
"A firm but fresh wine, the black currant fruit flavors right to the fore. Tannins are solid, dry, but fit well with the fruit profile. There is final fresh acidity."
"The alcohol certainly gives the wine richness, but it manages to sustain it well, with superripe black plum and damson flavors, dusty tannins and a powerful texture that rolls richly around the mouth. It leaves a sweet and juicy aftertaste like old-style Rioja."
"Soft, dusty tannins balance a wine that is full of the ripest fruit. It has power, but gentle power, with rounded corners and a texture that is dense, never hard. The fruits are ripe plums, perhaps lacking final freshness."
"A burnt-toast, spicy aroma is followed by fresh black currant flavors. This is a light wine, but it is balanced, with the wood fitting well into the fruit. Drink now."
"A top Cuvée from Château Cheval Noir, with wood dominating the plum juice fruits. It is tough, the tannins giving considerable dryness, while the fruit behind seems lightweight."
"A smooth wine, rich for the vintage, with black currant and bright fruits and a strong underlay of wood. The acidity, though, is quite striking, with the freshest fruit and tight tannins."
"An impressively intense wine, concentrated and solid. The fruits are firm and tannic, with a new wood element that seems well in balance. A good success for the year."
"The wine has developed well, with plenty of weight, but the fruit seems a little diffuse, soft, open in character. It's masking the tannin core, a wine that opens slowly and carefully."
"A perfumed, finely structured wine, with firm, dusty tannins. The wood is well-balanced with acidity and some generous weight, finishing with black fruits and intense freshness."
"A wine with some density, spiced with touches of wood, dusty tannins and an open sweet plum flavor. There is plenty of wood here, layering the fruit. The wine has aging potential, worth waiting 4-5 years."
"There is good density here, a wine that seems well balanced and integrated. It has a solid, firm kernel, but this is balanced with great fresh acidity as well as blackberry fruits. The wine still seems to be coming together after bottling, and certainly needs 4-5 years."
"A big, bitter chocolate and new wood-dominated wine, the wine's spice coming from wood and also fig and cocoa flavors. There is acidity, and fresh berry fruits coming through the dark, black character."
"Spice and blackberry jelly fruits give a wine that has attractive fruity, ripe Cabernet tannins, acidity, but not a huge structure. There is great freshness, but maybe the wine as a whole is a little lean."
"A solidly structured wine, filled with fig, bitter coffee, spice and wood over a firm structure of tannins. The freshness is quite intense, but the ripe fruit is vivid with layered acidity and new wood. This is a serious wine, for aging."
"With plenty of new wood, the wine has a velvet character, smooth and round. Only gradually does a plum skin, bitter chocolate element come in, giving structure and weight. This is a wine that should age well."
"While there is certainly plenty of wood here, the wine has weight and impressive concentration for the year. The tannins are still brooding away, giving a dark firm character to the wine. Blackberry fruits and acidity are there, but still well buried in the tannins."
"Very toasty wood aromas, the wine itself packed with new wood, fresh spice, the fruit lost somewhere at this stage. But it does have some weight and underlying hints of concentration."
"Situated on the plateau of Saint-Emilion, just east of the city, Château le Prieuré has produced a finely structured 2007, not big, but well balanced. Touches of cocoa and cinnamon spice cap the solid fruit and dry tannins. Age for 3-4 years."
"With its dry, tight texture, this is an austere wine. The fruit is full of piercing black currant acidity, structured with firm tannins. Smoky wood does give an extra dimension, but the wine needs several months more in bottle."
"Wood dominates this wine, the wine itself relatively light, but finely composed. There are spicy tannins with intense acidity, crisp black currants, bursting through the overlay of wood."
"A ripe, big solid wine, almost chunky in character, smooth and velvet in texture, without much in the way of tannins. Its attractive chocolate flavors give it ripeness and make it ready to drink."
"There is a good core of tannin here, the fruit sweet plums and ripe tannins, relatively soft and easy. Only that kernel of tannin offers some aging possibility."
"Very fresh, with well-judged wood and very juicy fruit, a wine that is almost shocking in its youthful acidity. It bursts in the mouth, fruit and bright."
"This wine comes from a seven-acre estate that is planted with a balance of Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It is firm, with perfumed tannins and black fruit. Aged for 12 months in wood, the wine has a rich texture, lightly spicy and with great potential. Drink from 2023."

The tannins and structure promise serious aging while also supporting the generous fruit. Drink from 2024."

"A recent acquisition of the Janoueix family, this estate is getting into its stride. This wine has plenty of the rich black fruit of the vintage along with a firm structure that will allow it to age. Flavors from the new wood used for aging show in the spice and the dry core of the wine. Drink this ripe wine from 2024."
"Balanced and with a good partnership between the crisp berries and some firm tannins, this is a fruity wine. The generous, perfumed Merlot and plenty of acidity give everything a lift. Drink this wine soon, certainly from 2019."

"This rich, dense wine is opulent and full of black fruits. The very ripe Merlot has given concentration, dark tannins and berry flavors, as well as the alcohol. Wood aging has made the wine, if anything, richer. Drink from 2021."
"Vineyards on the site of a monastery and east of the town of Saint-Émilion have produced a richly tannic and structured wine. It is firm, textured and concentrated. Dark chocolate as well as black-plum flavors give the wine its serious richness. It needs time; drink from 2024."

"Well balanced and poised, this wine has plenty of ripe black fruits plus a delicious streak of crispness and acidity. The tannins are still firm in this young wine. Let it fill out, although it will still retain that fresh edge. Drink from 2022."
"This estate is located in the east of Saint-Émilion. The wine is rich, a powerful statement of Merlot in this ripe vintage. Generous tannins and a light hint of perfume from the 10% Cabernet Franc in the blend give the wine weight. Wood aging mingles with crisp acidity and ripe blackberry fruits. Drink this wine from 2023."
"A third wine from Château Laroze, this is a powerful, yet open blend of 70% Merlot with 30% Cabernet Franc. Spice as well as dense black fruits reflect the best in both grapes. The structured wine is likely to age further. Drink from 2021."
"The blend, dominated by 80% Merlot, gives this wine a broad, rich character. Unusually for Saint-Émilion, the other 20% is Cabernet Sauvignon, which brings in its hallmark black-currant flavors. Together, the two varieties have produced a ripe wine that will age well over the medium term. Drink from 2021."

"Richly endowed with spice and wood-aging flavors, this is a firm and toasty wine. In many years, the wood would have been too much, but not in this vintage. The black fruit weight will balance with the wood as it ages to give an elegant, juicy wine ready to drink from 2022."

Over 90% Merlot from the valley below the hill of Saint-Émilion gives this soft and supple wine. Its tannins and smoky character are integrated into the bold black fruits and acidity. This rich wine will develop relatively quickly. Drink from 2021.
"From vines on the flat outcrop of Saint-Émilion near the Dordogne river, this soft wine is smooth and will age quickly. Its blackberry fruit is ripe, with a lift by acidity, while the tannins are gentle with just a touch of dryness. Drink the wine from 2020."
"Made with 45% Cabernet Franc, this great wine offers a beautiful, rich and perfumed character. It was an exceptional vintage for the estate, which incorporated fruit from parcels of the vineyard that would normally be used for the chateau's second wine into this blend. It is packed with black-fruit flavors and broad tannins, with a background of juicy acidity and a firm structure. Drink from 2027."

Now close to the top of the classification tree in Saint-Émilion, this vintage shows the impressive nature of this powerful wine. With a good balance between acidity and black fruits backed up by tannins, the wine is powerful and stylish. Drink from 2027."
"This magnificent wine brings together the great fruit of the vintage in a complex structure. The acidity, ripe tannins and power of this dense wine are enormous, as is its aging potential.

"This wine is dense with superripe tannins. It has rich black-plum and berry fruits along with an opulent texture typical of this wine in good vintages. Along with its power, the wine has great acidity to keep the aftertaste crisp and fruity. Drink from 2024."
"This powerful wine has great structure, fine and elegant tannins, and ripe black fruits. It wears its heart on its sleeve. The concentration doesn't take away from the juicy fruit and wealth of complex flavors. A wine with a great future, it won't be ready to drink before 2026."

"Owned by the Riviére family, which also owns a Saint-Émilion-based negociant firm, this estate has produced a generous, ripe wine. The 85% Merlot in the blend gives a jammy, rich character that will soften and broaden as the wine matures. A firm structure within the rich fruitiness will allow the wine to develop. Drink from 2024."
"This seven-acre property is located to the west of the city of Saint-Émilion on the chalk plateau. This gives the texture to the wine and also the good exposure has added to its richness. Structured with solid tannins and rich with black damson fruits, the wine is ready to age. Drink from 2023."

"Although the fruit says this wine is mature, the structure makes it firm and dry. Typical of this always-tough vintage, the wine is packed with firm tannins and concentration. Drink now."
"Situated to the east of the village of Saint-Émilion, overlooking the Dordogne Valley, this estate has produced a ripe wine in this fruity vintage. With some solid tannins to back up the generous black fruits, it is still young, so best wait to drink until 2019."

"This classy wine is rich, with its firm structure still intact. It has bold tannins, ripe blackberry fruit and bright acidity. Its concentration, together with its dry, tannic core, confirms that it will age further. Drink from 2020."
"This smooth, rich and fine wine is maturing well. It has a good balance of ripe fruit and acidity. Bitter coffee and spice notes add complexity while not detracting from the fruit. Drink from 2020."
"This is the first vintage of this new purchase by Sylvie Cazes, a leading figure in the Bordeaux wine scene. A classed growth, it's richly fruity yet structured and firm, with dense tannins and layers of delicious black fruit. With its tannins still well at the fore, it will need to age further, so drink from 2022."
"This rich and generous Grand Cru Classé is full of dark fruit and tannins and is ready to drink. It has weight, juicy acidity and black plum and berry flavors. Ripe, with the perfume of Cabernet Franc, it's entering maturity now and should very drinkable until at least 2025."

"This ripe wine is full of the fruit that's typical of the vintage, with its bursts of red berry flavor and layers of wood. It has a crisp edge from plenty of acidity and a good concentration that gives it the weight it needs. Drink from 2020."
"This second wine of classed growth Château Dassault is still young. It has tannins and a dense texture that comes from its rich fruit and high alcohol. However, it's balanced and jammy, with ripe blackberry flavors and a sense of restrained power. Drink from 2020."
"Still very young, this ripe Merlot-dominated wine is packed with dark plum and rich damson fruit flavors. They balance the serious amount of wood influence that gives it its spice and ageability. Drink from 2023."
"This is a monster of a wine. 100% very ripe Merlot, it shows a power and density that is still firm and structured. With age, that concentration will turn into beautiful richness. But don't doubt its power. Drink from 2021."
"The second label of classed growth Château Chauvin, this wine is structured yet bears all the fruit that is characteristic of the vintage. Finely balanced, its acidity and black fruit flavors work together to create a wine that needs to age further. Best from 2020."
"Full of the bright fruit typical of the vintage, this wine is made from 90% Merlot with a touch of Cabernet Franc. It's structured with still-young tannins and is dominated by red berry fruit, needing to age until 2021."
"Profiting from the ripeness of the 2015 vintage, this 65% Merlot wine is rich and soft. The balance of Cabernet Franc in the blend lends spice, perfume and a fine tannic structure. Drink from 2019."
"Now blossoming, this wine from a generally fruity vintage is delicious to drink. Poised and stylish, it shows integrated black fruit and wood, feeling balanced and almost ready. Drink from 2018."

"Smoky aromas from wood aging lead to a richly structured palate that's packed with tannins. It's extracted, with a bitter coffee character and black fruit flavors that are slowly developing. Drink from 2020."
"Owned by the Dassault aerospace family, this Château is producing some fine wines, like this crisp, textured second label. With its juicy acidity from the fruity vintage, it has delicious black currant flavors and is likely to age quickly. Drink from 2019."
"This second wine from the estate offers spice and mushroom aromas that indicate it's now mature. Ripe and smooth, with attractive secondary flavors, it's spicy, meaty and ready to drink."
"This dense wine is now beginning to mature. It has the bold black fruit of the vintage, which is overlaid by dark chocolate notes and some bitterness. Still firm, it will probably need to age. Drink from 2019."
"This wine is soft and juicy, with attractive red berry fruit. Reflecting the vintage, it's a light with a dry core that will soften soon. The aftertaste is dry. Drink from 2018."
"From vines to the east of Saint-Émilion city, this wine is structured and firm. It will take time for the black fruit to come through, so drink from 2019."
"While this wine still has the firm, tannic core typical of this vintage, it also has a mature character that shows it's ready to drink. Dry tannins and a ripe, spicy character mingle on the palate. Drink now."
"From vines on the plateau to the west of the village of Saint-Émilion, this is a light, fruity wine. Its acidity and tannic structure lend a crisp texture to its black currant fruit. It will probably broaden as it matures, so drink from 2019."
"Still very firm, this wine shows the tannic structure of the vintage. Because it's beginning to mature, it also shows it's not likely to open up much more. Big and hard to like."
"The 100% new oak used in the aging of this wine was not a good idea. It has given too much woodiness and not enough fruit. Still young, it may soften enough to allow the generous blackberry flavors to come through."
"Barrel aged for 12 months, this 95% Merlot wine (with a dash of Cabernet Franc) is very dominated by its wood. That gives it a seriously toasty character that dominates the fruit. At five years old, it should be more balanced."
"It is fascinating how some wines from this vintage have gone from youth to old age without passing maturity. That's the case here: this wine is showing age, with tannins that have become dry, leaving the secondary flavors, let alone the fruit, behind."
"A big, solid wine, with dark flavors and dense tannins, very dry. The high extraction and wood tastes are still young, and at this stage the wine needs decanting. Ideally it needs time to smooth out."
"Under the watchful eye of consultant Michel Rolland, Candale has produced an intense, powerful expression of super-ripe Merlot. The tannins are dense, powering through the dark berry fruit, rounded by the wood. It could do with 4-5 years aging."
"Big, rich and elegant, this wine has fine, lifted black fruits layered over dry new wood and fruit tannins. It is certainly firm, and needs at least 4-5 years' aging, but it will develop into a sophisticated, balanced wine."
"Great wafts of sweet fruit and ripe tannins show this wine well. Its fruit is balanced, the power behind it well judged alongside the fresh juicy black currant flavors and acidity. The texture is certainly dense, and the wine needs time. Give it 4-5 years."
"Immediately delicious with its licorice, black fruit and spice combo, this is a rich wine, hedonistic almost, soft in structure. There is no aging needed here, for with its softness and super-ripeness, this needs to be drunk-and with pleasure-over the next year."
"Huge, bitter chocolate-flavored wine, spiced with cinnamon, sweet herbs and intense new wood flavors. It benefits from very ripe fruit, but with all its great richness, the wine manages to keep a sense of balance, the acidity cutting through the opulence to leave a fresh finish."
"The second wine of Château Fonplégade is dark, brooding, powerful. There are sweet chocolate and spice flavors that  even manage to dominate the solid, ripe black berry fruits. Certainly rich, it misses the freshness of acidity."
"Still young, still forming its tannin and fruit balance, this is likely to turn into a strongly structured wine. The black fruits are in place, the dry tannic core is dense, and, at this stage, the acidity is prominent. Give it 3 years."
"Fine tannins, dusty and sweet, play a major part in the success of this wine. It's fruit, initially subdued by the tannins, then bursts through with cherry jelly, dark plums and an edge of licorice. It's certainly rich, but it all hangs together well."
"A bright, vivid, black-fruited wine, which brings out a fine tobacco scented streak of Cabernet Franc to go with the rich Merlot. The tannins are there, but balanced with the rich, dried fruits, the spice and the new wood. Worth aging for 3-4 years."
"Minty overtones set the scene for a smoothly textured wine that shows rich, super-ripe fruit, blackberry jam flavors and a dense, dusty tannic structure. It is sweet, modern in style, a wine that doesn't want to keep anything back."
"This is a style of wine that offers a blockbuster view of Bordeaux. It is full of dark extracted fruits, brooding tannins, dark plum juice and a burnt feeling that comes from alcohol. In its style, it goes for excess."
"The second wine of Fonplégade is soft, gentle, the tannins firmly surprised behind a velvet texture and ripe fruit. There is a jammy, sweet quality to the wine, and it is ready to drink now."
"Black plums fresh acidity combine with a good weight from dusty tannins and a good juicy undertow. The wine suggests a property on the way up, a marked improvement on previous vintages, with balance ripeness and aging potential."
"Already mature, this is a light, mushroom and spice flavored wine. The fruit is now a part of the secondary flavors, a nutmeg sweetness giving some interest. To be drunk now."
"Jammy and ripe, from gravel soils in the valley plain of Saint-Emilion, this is already a very drinkable wine. It has intense, concentrated red and black berry fruits surrounding a core of seriously dry tannins from fruit and wood. Solid but rich, this is developing well."
"As a contrast to Jonathan Maltus's Le Carré, this single-vineyard wine, from vines situated only 100 yards away, has a taut, mineral flavor, with an initial austere character which then opens out to give dark bitter chocolate and plum skin flavors. It is potentially a richer, more impressive wine, but it needs aging for 4-5 years."
"From a small, single-vineyard plot of 3.5 acres, this shows intense fruit, very aromatic in character. Its concentration is immense, dark black fruits vying with spice, tar and sweet plum pudding flavors. The Cabernet Franc shows through well here, giving a perfumed finish."
"Benefiting from the great quality of Cabernet Franc in 2006, this is a beautiful wine, perfumed and seductive. The fruit tannins are so well integrated with wood that they are only just dominant. Ripe, opulent but also firmly structured, this will age magnificently over five years or more."
"Although it begins with austerity, its acidity and tannins dominant,  the palate opens beyond its youthfulness after a few moments. It becomes dark and powerful, certainly still dryly tannic, but the fruit is generous, and the final taste is of beautiful, ripe fruits."
"Dominated by new wood, this wine has not yet found its true character. It will likely become rich and juicy, with black plum and spice flavors coming forward in 2-3 years. For the moment, it is all about firmness and dryness."
"Ripe Merlot pushes through the tight tannins that are still evident in this wine. This dark, dry core dominates initially, and needs time to open up to show the vivid black currant flavors, touched with dried fruits and fresh finishing acidity."
"Aromas of smoky new wood and blackberries set the scene for a wine that brings out a soft, supple texture, followed by fresh black fruits and light structure. The second wine of Château Corbin Michotte is attractively fresh, smoky and ready to drink."
"A ripe, smooth, smoky wine, in which the fruit is dense, almost sweetly rich. Spicy wood is a strong component, going right above the berry fruit flavors. This is an immediate, fruity, ready-to-drink wine."
"This is a New World-style of Bordeaux, all polished edges, and sweet, ripe fruit. There is structure and dry tannins, but these are well integrated into the smooth black cherry and dried fig flavors that are given extra interest by a herbal edge. The aftertaste is fresh, keeping acidity."
"Dark fruits, bitter chocolate and black plums all come together in this dense, firm wine that never loses sight of sweetness. Alongside the structure, there is still plenty of juicy fruit that lifts the wine, especially in the aftertaste."
"Planted in the eastern half of Saint-Emilion, this Merlot-dominated vineyard also benefits from Cabernet Franc. That gives the aromatic nature of the powerful fruit. For the rest, there is richness, dark black juicy fruits and intensity, all held together by a fine structure."
"Le Carré is a 3.5-acre vineyard close to the town of Saint-Emilion, producing a highly perfumed wine showing exciting Cabernet Franc character. The texture is dark and dense, although the sweetness of the fruit is very evident. Fleshy and ripe."
"Dark-hued and concentrated, this wine also has a considerable mineral character, along with intense bitter chocolate and dark plum skin flavors. It's juicy, but also broody, massive and dominated by its solid tannins. Keep for 5-10 years."
"An aristocratic, perfumed wine dominated by delicious Cabernet Franc. Beneath this elegant exterior, there is also power from intensely concentrated fruit and tannins. The wine is already well integrated, the wood only here by feel, balancing so well with the fruit. To finish, sweet fruit and dusty tannins combine easily."
"Soft, ripe and rounded, this shows a gentle side of Bordeaux. The tannins are sweet, just hinting at wood, but this is more about blackberries and a finishing sweetness."
"Smoke and tobacco aromas go with dry, dusty tannins, dried fruits, strong spice and Cabernet Franc perfumes. This is all about dried flavors, the black fruits a supporting element, with a generous, full aftertaste over acidity."
"It may only contain 15% Cabernet Franc, but that grape imparts its signature perfume to this firmly dark wine. The tannins are ripe, if dry, the richness full, and the red plum and blackberry flavors are elegantly exuberant."
"A dark, extracted wine, loaded with very ripe fruit and dominated by new wood. It is generally soft, maybe missing structure, but certainly a great wine for lovers of ripe, sweet black fruits."
"Light and fresh with black currant flavors, this is a simple wine, with attractive, easy fruit, just given weight by tannins and some juicy finishing acidity."
"There's good density here. This wine shows plenty of ripe Merlot fruit flavors, jammy, lifted with dried fruits and blackberries. It's a rounded, ripe wine, but shot through with a curious, unbalanced, very dry wood element."
"A ripe, spicy wine, with a good blend of black fruits, spice and tannins from wood aging, and a layer of dry plum skins. It has plenty of Merlot tobacco aromas and dark fruit cake flavors."
"A very dry, tannic wine, full of dense structure. The fruit can be found underneath all this dryness, a layer of hedgerow blackberries, tight and firm. At the end, there is some baked acidity."
"This particular estate is small but has produced some good, solidly juicy ripe wine, with big black fruit and mocha flavors."
"This is young, dominated by some spicy wood and quite densely textured fruit and tannin. Impressive for a branded wine, all vibrant fruit, balanced by a firm, dry structure, and with a rich aftertaste. Age this for at least 1 year."
"Ripe, sweet and easy, with dried fruit flavors, some ripe fruit and light tannins. Perfumed and attractive; there's just a touch of bitterness from the wood."
"Starts off with vanilla and black cherry scents, with just a sprinkling of dried herbs. This blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc is creamy and supple through the mocha-tinged midpalate, then finishes crisper than expected, with some dusty tannins. Drink 2008-2015. Imported by Acadia Imports."
"Fresher and more floral than the 2003, with flavors that run toward mulberry while adding hints of vanilla and maple syrup. It's richer, creamier and longer than the 2003, showing the results of Seillan having full control over the property for the entire year. Drink now-2015."
"A hugely rich, concentrated wine for 2004, packed with ripe black plums and berries. This is a great success, with dry tannins balanced by delicious sweet fruit, finishing with a fresh, currant fruit aftertaste."
"Like the 2003, this is creamy and supple, but the fruit is fresher and livelier also. The result is a lovely blend of mocha, raspberry and spice accented by hints of vanilla and crushed herbs that linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now-2020."
"Frank was the son of Bernard Phélan, who created this estate in the mid 19th century. The second wine of the chateau, it is bold, ripe and judiciously aged in wood, offering great tannins and black fruit. A dense texture, black-plum flavors and perfumed acidity promise a good future. Drink from 2020."
"This third-generation property of seven acres is close to the village of Saint-Estéphe on the Pez plateau. Fruity and juicy, the wine is beginning to approach maturity. Its tannins and wood aging are still showing although they are beginning to be well integrated. Wait a few years and drink this wine from 2023."
"This Estager family's structured blend of Merlot, Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc and Petit Verdot has good aging potential. It is a rich, firm wine packed with great fruit and juicy acidity. Smoky, ripe and generous, the wine will age well. Drink from 2023."
"From parcels within the Phélan-Ségur vineyard, this wine is juicy although with the tannins typical of the appellation. With its powerfully structured, rich blackberry fruits and acidity, it is likely to age well, giving a wine ready to drink from 2023."
"Ripe, spicy and with a good line of acidity, black-currant fruit and an aromatic character, this is a balanced wine. It is poised, with soft tannins that are well integrated into the wine's structure. Drink from 2020."
"With its aromas of new wood, spice and black fruits, this promises from the start to be a powerful, polished wine. It is dense, very ripe (from the high percentage of Merlot in the blend), but still packed with tannins. It's a massive wine, bringing together the heat of 2003 with the big tannins of Saint-Estéphe. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This Roederer-owned property has produced an impressive wine this vintage. Full, plump and rich, and packed with firm black fruits which are layered with fine, pure acidity. This is a wine that is likely to age, over 5-10 years. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA."
"The Cuvelier family of Léoville-Poyferré owns this property. The wine shows in the dense, ripe fruit, with dusty tannins and concentration. The fruit is generous, but it has good dry tannins to give it shape as well as depth of flavor. A wine to age 10-12 years, but certainly drinkable sooner."
"Under the ownership of the Gardinier family, this chateau now rivals some of the classed growths, and deserves its crus bourgeois exceptionnel classification. It is certainly full of new wood flavors, but these are not allowed to dominate dense fruit tannins, flavors of black plums and fine layers of acidity. Will certainly age for 10+ years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"One of the stars in the world of the crus bourgeois, categorized as cru bourgeois exceptionnel in 2003, this wine is qualitatively at the level of many classed growths. Its rich fruit is punctuated with toasty new wood flavors, which should soften and balance in the next few years. An impressive wine that shows great power."
"One of the nine crus bourgeois exceptionnel, this estate is under the ownership of the Cazes family of Château Lynch-Bages. With the same winemaking team, it's no wonder that Ormes de Pez is up with classed growths in quality. The character of 2003 gives this wine black tarry flavors, but it hasn't spoiled the wine's dry tannins, structure or its long-term potential. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"A powerfully velvety wine, which still packs a walloping punch of Saint-Estéphe tannins. The fruit, under these tannins, is pure, ripe, black and generous. But there is the proper dryness that shows how the team at Calon-Ségur managed to tame some of the excesses of the 2003 vintage. This will develop, slowly, into a great wine. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Thought by many tasters to be the wine of the vintage at the time of the 2004 barrel tastings. Has it retained that status? It is certainly a hugely powerful wine, monumental even. It is also finely balanced, with great dark tannins working in partnership with brooding black fruit. The question is whether it is too big, too powerful: only time will tell. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"From a mosaic of 90 different scattered parcels, oenologue Georges Pauli has constructed a firm style of wine, with Saint-Estéphe's characteristic tannins and fresh black currant fruits. This is a structured wine, which should certainly age well. Imported by Fruit of the Vines, Inc."
"Meyney is often the most gentle of the great estates of Saint-Estéphe, and in 2003 this character is most obvious. The wine is full of vitality and ripeness, soft tannins showing the property more than the hot year. The fruit dominates right through the wine, with dryness only appearing in the aftertaste."
"A powerful, spicy wine that is dominated by wood and toast. The fruit is black but relatively lightweight, and is suffering at this stage from the strong wood flavors."
"Under the ownership of the Cazes family (also owners of Lynch-Bages), this estate produces richly satisfying wines, even in lighter years like 2002. This is finely constructed, with acidity along with the tannins and dense black fruits. It certainly has power, but there is also great elegance."
"Husky and muddled, with less than precise plum and berry flavors. The flavor profile doesn't sing and the finish is lean, drying and even a touch bitter at its culmination."
"The aromas are all dominated by new wood. But to taste, this super cru bourgeois is all about fruit. It is sweet, generous, not having typical Saint-Estéphe tannins, but showing more elegance. A great success."
"This is initially a somewhat austere wine, but that derives from the tannins of Saint-Estéphe. Underneath those tannins are solid, chunky fruits and a great generosity and richness."
"This is a solid, huge wine, with rich but very dry tannins. With its dense, almost black color, and its sense of brooding power, it promises long aging. It will never be in the opulent Bordeaux camp, despite its prominent new wood flavors, but will probably outlive all but a handful top wines."
"For a Saint-Estéphe this is surprisingly supple at this stage. The density is all in the exotic fruit, while the tannins are more of a background. That suggests this is a wine that will develop relatively fast, but it is going to give great pleasure along the way."
"Typical of  Saint-Estéphe, this wine is totally closed up. It is more tannins than fruit at this stage of its development. But it is obvious that there is fruit there, and that it will develop. But for now, it's a case of watch this space."
"With its fine, ripe tannins and immediately attractive acidity, this is a wine which looks set to develop relatively fast but with style."
"This Bordeaux from Abarbanel is full of black cherry, root, and oak. All in all it's not bad. Some sweet cherry is at the core, and on the edges you'll find a slight leafiness and some sweet supporting oak. Integrated tannins make the finish smooth. --M.S."
"A plump and full wine with forest, cedar, cocoa and black fruit aromas. Handsome fruit with earth, plum and carob elements on the palate. Earthy finish of medium length, with some drying tannins. Already drinkable, it should shine even more in two years."
"Darker aromas and flavors than the '95. There is a slight menthol coolness to the cassis flavors; tobacco and cedar accents are strong. The mouthfeel is big and structured. The finish is long, with lots of flavor and broad tannins. A keeper. Hold for four to eight years."
"Deeper and more powerful than the '95, with robust black currant, coffee, and cedar aromas and flavors. Rich, nicely balanced mouthfeel and a long, full finish with plenty of tannins. Hold for three to five years, or drink with very hearty fare."
"A much less dense wine than either '95 or '96, reflecting the vintage. Red berry fruit aromas with dusty tobacco notes. Lighter, juicy mouthfeel with chocolate and leather notes. Mildly drying finish. Well-made but light, with a definite herbaceous quality."
"A fairly forward wine with a strong nose of cassis, earth, herbs and tobacco. Spicy plum and roasted red berry flavors on the open, fairly supple palate. Has good fruit and a full finish with moderate tannins that dispalys licorice and dark fruit flavors. Good now, better in two years."
"An open and easy wine, and very nicely done for this tough year. Red-fruit aromas, with cedar and herb accents. Lighter cabernet flavors. Shows good balance and a creamy mouthfeel. Finish is medium-length and pleasant. Drink now."
"The estate is a small enclave within the Château Tour des Termes which is owned by the same family. Half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine has a smoky character from the wood aging. That balances with the rich black fruits and intense fruity acidity. It is likely to be ready to drink from 2018."
"The are firm indications of wood aging in this wine, meaning it needs some time. For now, it is all spice and exuberant blackberry fruits. As it develops, it will integrate well to produce a rich wine with plenty of blackberry and damson fruits. Drink from 2021."
"This is the second wine from this prestigious Saint-Estéphe estate. It is just showing maturity as its sheds the tannic shell typical of the vintage and offers secondary, beautifully ripe flavors that retain their structure and fine acidity. There is a leather and spice character that finishes the wine in great style. Drink now."
"This is the second wine of the Phélan-Ségur estate. With its firm tannins and layers of wood aging, it is a wine that will need time. At this stage, the wine is dry although the rich berry fruits offer intensity and the potential for a fine wine. Drink from 2020."
"The wine is rich, with firm young tannins as well as generous blackberry fruits. The dry core of the wine will certainly soften as this ripe wine matures. The blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in almost equal measure, gives the wine its balanced fruity aftertaste. Drink from 2020."
"Already a soft wine, this is packed with fruit. Yes, there are tannins, but they are well integrated into the berries. It is fruity and juicy, with hints of wood aging. Drink from 2019."
The wine is almost mature. It has a minty edge with some firm tannins and plenty of balanced fruit and acidity. It benefits from the propitious conditions in this appellation during the difficult 2013 vintage and shows ripe fruit and a generous berry aftertaste. Drink from 2019.
"This is a beautifully perfumed wine. With a high proportion of ripe Cabernet Franc, it is not only structured but has a fine dried fruit character that gives the wine a memorable richness. The wine is tight with its tannins, likely to age over decades. Drink from 2027."
"This is an immensely dense wine that is going to be a classic. The dark tannins are still lined with wood aging but that will go because the fruit underneath is also just as dense and intense. Blackberry, black plum and damson plum give power and sweetness. This is a great wine with huge potential. Drink from 2028."
"This is a very fine wine showing a new level of quality at Montrose. With its almost velvet tannins inside the intense black fruits, the wine is rich, smooth and generous. Blackberry and black-plum fruits are to the fore along with the fine acidity and great structure. A wine to age for decades, it will be ready to drink from 2027."
"Under the ownership of Jacky Lorenzetti, president of one of France's top rugby clubs, this estate is now performing impressively. The wine is finely structured with dark tannins and tight acidity and a hint of minerality. It is Merlot dominated, although it is the 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that brings out the black-currant fruitiness. Drink from 2022."
"This estate, dating to the 18th century and close to the Gironde estuary, has produced a rich wine. Young tannins and fine fruity acidity are both present in a wine that is serious and dense. Its weight, ripeness and the potential of the black-currant fruit will all allow it to age. Drink from 2022."
"Packed with the dark tannins and structure of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine, produced by the team of Calon Ségur is intense, concentrated and dark. It has a firm structure, solid and with a luscious aftertaste. The acidity of the year just shows at the end. Drink from 2026."
"This second wine of Calon Ségur is beautifully proportioned. It is fruity with rich tannins. At the same time, the crisp fruit of the vintage gives a lift to the deep concentration. Let the wine develop over several years. Drink from 2024."
The second wine of Cos d'Estournel is powerfully packed with tannins and dark ripe fruit. It is enormously rich and intense while keeping a fine smooth texture. There is a dark core that is going to allow the wine to develop over many years. Drink from 2024.
"The wine is powerful with fine tannins and concentrated black fruits. The dense texture is lifted by the acidity and beautiful fruit of the vintage. The tannins are dusty, tight and surrounded by beautiful fruit and acidity. This, the second wine of Montrose, will develop surely over the next several years. Drink from 2024."
"Owned by the Cuvelier family of Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien and with Michel Rolland as consultant, this is a fine estate with an equally fine chateau. It is dense and richly endowed with black fruits and spice. At the same time, it has style and a way with its fruit and acidity that give it a lift. Drink this very ageworthy wine from 2023."
"The wine, with its 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, is solidly structured with plenty of the firmness that is characteristic of young Saint-Estéphe. To go with this structure, the wine is also full of perfumed black fruits that are already delicious. It will be a rich serious wine as it develops over the next several years. Drink from 2022."
"This small property is in the same ownership as nearby Château Clauzet. The wine, half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, is dense with bright black-currant flavors under the firm tannins. These and the wood-aging flavors will integrate well, giving a concentrated wine to drink from 2021."
"Big-hearted fruit dominates this smooth wine. The estate, owned by the Tesseron family and close to their other property of Pontet-Canet, is performing well and it shows in this juicy ripe wine, full of generous tannins. The aftertaste shows both acidity and concentration. Drink from 2022."
The initial wood flavors in this wine rapidly give way to rich fruit. Spice and black-plum flavors are built by a firmly tannic superstructure. The aftertaste brings out the acidity. This wine should develop well over the long term. Drink from 2023.
"The wine has powerful tannins which are balanced with equally rich fruit. It is firm, in the Saint-Estéphe style, while never losing sight of a rich fruity future. The wine, from an estate at the heart of the Pez plateau, will develop well. Drink from 2024."
"Lafon-Rochet is an estate that is producing some very fine wines. This second wine is a good reflection of the quality. With its powerful tannins and dark concentration, it is a still young. Blackberry fruits are paired with the dry core of tannin to give a wine for aging. Drink from 2019."
"The second wine from this estate, which is currently performing very well, is a rich and opulent wine, typical of the vintage. It has generous black fruits, concentrated tannins and a firm core. All of this points to a wine that will be delicious to drink. Wait until 2018."
"Still firm with tannins, this is also a rich, generous wine. It has mint aromas that follow through on to the palate with wood-aging flavors. Bold blackberry fruit and juicy acidity balance the structure and give the wine a ripe character. The wine will be ready to drink from 2018."
This is an impressive wine that transcends the problems of the vintage. It has rich fruit that is sustained by the tannic structure that rests on a bed of fresh blackberry fruits cut with fresh acidity. The wine will certainly age well. Don't think about drinking it before 2024.
"Powered by its structure and texture, this complex wine is dense, structured and firm. Plenty of dry and taut tannins dominate at this stage, but it is also full of fruit. The wine will age over many years while not being one of those vintages that will mature forever: the fruitiness will see to that. Drink this impressive wine from 2025."
"The second wine of Château Meyney comes from one of the top estates of the appellation. From selected parcels and barrels of wine, this shows the same sense of structure as the top wine, while the fruitiness is developing more quickly. The black currant and plum-juice flavors are already bursting from the tannins. Drink from 2017."
"With fine, dusty tannins, this rich and juicy wine wears its fruit on its sleeve, all black plums and blackberry flavors. The acidity of the year is almost sweet with the fresh ripeness of the fruit. It is developing well, showing a medium-term future. Drink from 2018."
"This wine is full of juicy Merlot, ripe with sweet tannins and jammy fruit. It is soft, with the freshness of the year as well as having hints of structure. It is ripe, beautifully fruity and will be ready to drink from 2018."
"With the talents of the winemaking team at Château Léoville Poyferré behind it, this wine is ripe, and smooth, with a core of tannin. Concentrated and dry, it needs time to mature and reveal its solid, structured potential. Drink from 2019."
"This wine has a good structure that's overlaid with wood flavors and given richness by the generous black fruits, but everything is in balance. The dry core is enveloped by the fruit and fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2020."
"From one of the fine estates on the Pez plateau at the heart of Saint-Estéphe, this firm and structured wine seems at this stage to have absorbed too much wood flavor, which gives toughness. However, plenty of fruit is currently being masked, so the wine should develop well. Drink from 2018."
"This is a finely etched wine with just the right balance between its ripe fruits and tannins. Structured while also juicy, it has a mint and black-currant freshness as well as a dry core that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018."
"With 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a structured wine, firm with tannins that contrast with the black-currant fruits. Still full of young tannins, it will develop well over the next few years. Wait to drink until 2019."
"This wine brings out the tannic side of Saint-Estéphe. However, the 2013 is less wood-laden than some previous vintages from this estate, allowing more room for the fresh fruits and ripe tannins. The wine therefore has good potential, drink from 2020."
"Firmly structured, this dark and dense wine packs a punch of tannins, giving a dry core. The judicious wood-aging supports the black-currant fruitiness that is developing well. It should be ready to drink from 2017."
"What is so good about this wine is its balance. The producer has accentuated the fruit of the vintage, leaving aside any big tannic structure. The result is a black-currant wine that is juicy, fresh and developing well. Drink from 2017."
"While this wine has plenty of tannins, the generous blackberry fruits dominate. It is balanced with a fresh character that brings out just the right amount of acidity. The dry core will allow the wine to develop. Drink from 2018."
"Parcels of vines on the Phélan-Ségur estate are used for this second label. The wine, with its firm tannins, is developing well. It has structure and a dense texture along with ripe blackberry fruits and acidity. As it develops, it will be generous and ripe. Drink from 2018."
"This is one of the vintages from Cos that seems to pull out all the stops. The fruit is so rich, the texture so dense, and deep flavors of chocolate back up the huge structure. It does work in its magnificent, flamboyant way. And at the end, the acidity does its part and gives the wine a final lift. Drink from 2024."
"Firm and structured, this beautifully concentrated wine has plenty of the dark tannins that come out of Cabernet Sauvignon in Saint-Estéphe while allowing room for juicy fruit. The wood aging is still showing, giving some spice to the wine. At the end, it's the density of the wine that's so impressive. Drink from 2024."
"Always a structured wine, this vintage selection has dense fruit flavors and a scented, smoky character. It's full of fruit and structured tannin, with ample acidity and excellent cellaring potential. It's a complex wine that will age well; drink after 2018."
"The property of négociant Dourthe is producing some fine wines, including this 2012. It is structured and initially dry, typical of Saint-Estéphe. The fruit though is all there, pushing through the tannins and giving a rich, generous feel to the wine. It's going to age well; wait until 2018."
"Named after the Chinese facade of this most extraordinary of wineries, this wine is ripe and smooth in a style that brings out richness and a round character. It's already totally integrated, solid while also very generous."
"Dominated by ripe, juicy Merlot, this smooth wine has already integrated its tannins. Rich and opulent, it has a velvet texture and dusty tannins, along with plenty of acidity from the black currant fruits. Drink from 2017."
"Soft, open and fruity, this is an attractive wine from an estate owned by Calon-Ségur. There are some tannins, although they are cushioned by the rich black berry fruits and sweet structure. The wine is generous, almost ready to drink."
"Owned by the Cuveliers who also own Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien, Le Crock in 2012 is a powerhouse of ripe tannins and juicy acidity. It's a wine that demands aging with its tannins and still-youthful fruitiness. Drink from 2019."
"The small area of Pez is one of the top sites in Saint-Estéphe, with many highly rated chateaus. This is one. New wood aging shows strongly at this stage, although so does the fruit. That gives a structured wine, firm and also full of blackberry fruit flavors. The future is good for this wine, so drink from 2018."
"This sophisticated, wood-aged wine is perfumed with polished wood and black currant. The palate offers tight tannins and ample acidity. Although it is already ripe and fruity, the structure of the wine promises successful aging; drink from 2017."
"There is some good structure here, as befits a Saint-Estéphe, along with intense fruits and ripe blackberry flavors. That makes the wine both very drinkable now and gives it aging for the next two years. The aftertaste with its juicy acidity is already attractive."
"This wine has a rich core of black fruits, dense tannins and good acidity, offering testimony to the firm character of Saint-Estéphe. Concentrated. it will develop well. Wait until 2018."
"This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time develop, although it will provide density and ripe berry fruits in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s, is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017."
"The smoky aroma and toasty wood character smothers the fruit. It is a tough wine at this stage although it does hint at some of the 2012 juicy fruit flavors. Drink this firm, solid wine from 2018."
"This is a dark and probably too-tannic wine. A very dry, extracted character gives bitterness more than fruit. It's still young and has the Saint-Estéphe tannins in abundance, although its future with this dryness is uncertain."
"Still firm, this has dark chocolate and polished wood flavors, as well as dark plums and berries. With the tight acidity, it's a wine for aging, dark and concentrated for the future. Drink from 2018."
"Produced from young vines at Château Phélan-Ségur, this is a rich, spicy and open wine. It is bursting with fruitiness, packed with blackberries and with a rounded texture. Drink from 2016."
"A hard, too-toasty wine that is completely dominated by smoky wood flavors. Whatever fruit is there is swamped, only a juicy hint through the wine's weight."
"This is a modern, polished wine, solidly packed with dark tannins and dense fruits. A tough, tannic element shows through strongly, giving a counterpoint to the acidiy. Drink from 2017."
"While the wood is still very apparent in this wine, it does also have the rich fruit as a balance. The acidity, dark berry fruits and a fine juicy character go with the firm tannins and spicy wood character. Drink from 2017."
"As so often with Montrose, this is a powerful, concentrated and very structured wine. Dense tannins are paired with rich black fruits, although at this stage the wine also has a sense of austerity. Power, severity and complexity all make for a wine for long aging. Wait until 2019."
"Powerful, very rich and very concentrated, this epitomizes the opulent style of Cos d'Estournel. A sense of extraction is overwhelmed by the huge, ripe fruit. It shows velvet texture at first, but then the tannins come on strongly, leaving a wine that will age over many years. Drink from 2022."
"This wine has so many of the structural elements of a Saint-Estéphe, but also is enveloped by ripe fruitiness. Black in color and dense in character, it has sweetness from the plum juice fruits and great acidity. But it is also firm, powerfully projecting a serious potential. Drink from 2022."
"A very dry wine, it shows the traditional Saint- Estéphe hard tannins. That suggests it will develop slowly, gradually bringing out the potential of the red berry fruits and acidity as it develops into a fine, complex wine. Drink from 2017."
"Solid and firm, this initially tannic wine has ripe black fruits under the tough surface. It will take time to bring out the potential richness and complex flavors. Wait until 2018."
"Very dry at the start, this opens up well to give a rich and fruity wine. The tannins are still powerful and show that the wine needs to age. With licorice and smoky flavors, the wood element is still very present. Drink from 2018."
"This is a lean wine that feels to have only structure and very little fruit. There are dry, dense tannins and a firm texture that will only soften marginally."
"Oak influence shows strongly on this wine, giving a smooth texture and soft tannins. It has a light texture, fresh with black currant fruitiness attractively balanced with acidity. For the medium term, the wine should be drunk from 2015."
"A dark and dense wine, this offers richness and a good depth of flavor. Along with its concentrated black plum and damson fruits, it is also strongly structured, ripe and dense. It needs aging, so don't drink before 2018."
"Still dominated by its new wood aromas, this is a fine, structured wine that is only just setting out. It has fine weight, rich blackberry fruits and dark tannins. The spicy wood still needs to integrate, so drink from 2017."
"A fresh, fruity and sophisticated wine, this offers acidity balanced by dry tannins. It has juicy black currant fruits, hints of mint and a bright, smoky feel. The wine will obviously age, so drink from 2016."
"Light and fruity, this shows attractive red fruit, ample tannins and acidity. An earthy character to the wine is less pleasant."
"This is an architectural wine, very classical in its structure like so many of the top wines of 2010. It's powered by ripe tannins and beautiful black currant fruits. While the wine is gorgeously ripe, it also has a powerful dark and structured character. For long-term aging."
"This wine that shows the ripe tannins of Saint-Estéphe. It has a dry, dark core that's surrounded by rich black currant fruit. Situated close to Calon-Ségur, this is a stylish selection that exudes power and structure."
"A mint- and spice-flavored wine, this has concentrated tannins that structure the black plum and berry fruits. The flavors are rich, and the dense texture promises several years of aging."
"This firmly tannic wine, characteristic of Saint-Estéphe, is very dry. Underneath the dryness, there is a delicious, opulent juiciness that brings out black currant and plum flavors. It's obviously a wine for the long haul; keep for at least six years."
"Obviously wood-aged, with a smoky toast flavor, this is a wine that shows the power of Saint-Estéphe tannins in full force. At the same time, there is a blackberry character that adds richness and juiciness, which cuts through the dry core. Age for at least 7-8 years."
"This structured, concentrated wine is from an estate in the north of Saint-Estéphe. A dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend lends it firm, solid tannins as well as a juicy black-currant note. It's a wine for long-term aging; don't drink before 7-8 years."
"There is no mistaking the firm tannins of Saint-Estéphe in this wine. At the same time, these tannins are balanced with the generous ripe flavor of black fruit and almost-sweet acidity. The property was  created by Joseph Laffitte in 1759, right in the center of the Saint-Estéphe plateau."
"Powerful and dense, this has a great balance between the ripe blackberry fruit and the dark, smoky concentrated structure. Along with its equilibrium comes crisp acidity, lending freshness to this solid, firm wine. Age for at least four years."
"The wine comes from a small, seven-acre property. This 2010 is structured with a mineral character and chewy tannins. It is well balanced; the blackberry fruit synchronizes well with the dry texture and fresh acidity. Age for 4-5 years."
"The tannins are very fine, with rich fruitcake and smoky flavors. Red berry and black plums give a fruity character, along with delicious acidity. The wine is structured while still remaining very approachable."
"Enormous tannins, dominant black fruit and a solid, dense structure. The wine, packed with dark fruits, dry tannins, very firm in character. With its huge tannins as well as fruit, this is a wine that really needs many years of aging."
"With layers of wood, this is a structured wine, driven as much by tannins as fruit. It will need time for the dark plum fruit flavors to come through-St.-Estéphe is always likely to be firmly textured."
"Full-bodied wine, spiced with nutmeg and toast and give richness by sweet blackberry juice flavors. It is densely structured, rich with great fruit character as well as a powerful drive of rich tannins. Age this wine at least four years and more."
"A Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine, packed with tannins and flavors of new wood. The black fruits are rich from the vintage, warm and jammy. This is a wine with fine concentration, coming into balance, finishing with black currant acidity."
"A delicious wine, so fruity. It does have the proper tannins but it is a wine that is already approachable with its sweet fruits-a pleasure to taste. However, for the future, watch those tannins."
"This is a chateau that is getting better and better. This 2009 is packed with sweet fruit, impressive tannins and a complex dark structure. It is fruity, yet powerful, for good aging."
"At this stage, a wine that is dominated by wood. The weight and the ripe fruit are there as well to suggest potential dark fruits, black plums, damsons and a juicy character. The rich fruit should begin to show well in a year, but the wine needs aging 3-4 years."
"When a Bordeaux wine gets into a heavy bottle, it has something to prove. As here, when the wine has way too much wood and lacks fruit. It could balance out, but that is a long shot."
"With important flavors of new wood, dusty dry tannins and mint, this is a concentrated and powerful wine that also has elegance. It is ripe, rich with balancing acidity, and ready for aging."
"From a tiny, seven-acre property in Saint-Estéphe, this is a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine with black currant fruit and good, firm fruit tannins. There is a smoky wood element to balance the lively, youthful acidity."
"Projecting firm tannins, this wine has a big, powerful structure: black plum skins, chewy currants and smoky wood flavors. It's still young; keep it for six years."
"A core of dry tannins and an austere edge give a wine that is hard to like. There is some attractive berry fruit, but it is caught up in the hard character."
"A richly perfumed wine, with delicious flavors of raisins, dried plums and sweet tannins. It is an opulent wine, the acidity keeping a watchful eye over the ripeness. It is ready to drink now."
"Highly juicy wine, packed with tannins as well as black currants and red berries. Green pepper, spice and high acidity are strongly present."
"Fresh berry fruits, light tannins and stalky black currants, sustained by tannins. It is juicy, the wood a mist in the bright fruit flavors. There is some aging potential, maybe 4-5 years."
"Chocolate and solid fruit flavors in this exemplary wine. It is rich, the tannins balancing with blackberry fruit flavors. The density of the texture suggests good medium-term aging."
"With its perfumed aromas, this is a wine that has richness and sweetness, with soft velvet power. It has an intense wood element that needs to blend into the rest of the wine, but the sweet black currant and freshness provide a good balance. This is a seductive wine, with a fine solid character."
"A spicy, fruity wine, the structure relatively light but firmly dry, with a strong seasoning of black currant fruits. It is fresh, the fruit juicy and vibrant, with an edge of firm wood."
"A ripe wine, the wood a band of flavor through the sweet tannins and attractive fresh fruits. It has the lightness of the year, leaving the flavors coming from the bright fruits."
This small eight-acre estate is owned by negociant Cheval Quancard. The year has produced a success story for a wine that has a great balance as well as potential richness. Broad black fruit adds to the dense tannins of the appellation to create a bold wine that's likely to age well. Drink from 2023.
"This sumptuous, powerful wine has a great sense of structure and tannins. It is also overwhelmingly dense with black fruits and swathes of rich black currants. In this vintage, even more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual in the blend has given a ripe wine set for a far-distant future. Drink from 2026."
"Rich tannins and dense fruit are balanced with the relatively light texture of this wine, highlighting the freshness and lively black currant fruit. At the same time, the tannins are there, dry at the core of the wine and promising aging. This wine will be eady to drink from 2023."
"This wine is light and fruity, the blackberry flavors dominating the tannins. It has enough fruit to be drinkable almost immediately, although the aftertaste suggests a drier structure. Drink from late 2018, although the wine will be much better from 2021."
"Produced by the Saint-Estéphe cooperative, this wine has a good sense of richness along with a soft texture and generous black fruits. It is a confident wine, ripe and fruity, while also having enough tannins to age well. Drink from 2022."
"While this wine is rich, it has a classical demeanor, with fine tannins that support but never dominate the ripe black fruits. Full of juicy acidity, it offers black currants and some fine, firm tannins at the end. This will take some time to mature, and the wine will not be ready to drink before 2027."
"The rich wood and fruit of this wine already show good balance. The estate, owned by Bordeaux negociant Dourthe, is now on excellent form with this structured wine offering concentration and long-term aging. The tannins and the dry core from roughly equal proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot and a pinch of Petit Verdot promise great potential. Drink from 2025."
"This wine is dense, complex and with great tannins. It is powerful and rich, packed with black fruits. Good acidity gives the wine its freshness, its black-currant fruit and its potential longevity. Rich and with great aging potential, this is becoming a major wine in its own right rather than just a second wine of Cos d'Estournel. Drink from 2025."
"With Michel Rolland as consultant and the Cuvelier family, also owners of Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien, in charge, no wonder this is an impressive wine. It has put on weight since it was tasted at en primeur. Packed with tannins, dark fruits and potential, it is a wine for aging. Solid tannins march along with the black fruit, acidity and spice from wood aging. The wine will take its time and will not be ready before 2025."
"This is a dense wine, packed with black fruits and rich tannins. The dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon gives the wine its ripe, juicy black-currant flavors and good acidity. This 56-acre estate has made a wine that will age well. Drink from 2025."
"Generous in its ripe Merlot, this wine is sumptuous and full bodied. Although there are plenty of tannins, they give just the right structure to this wine. From a 74-acre property that is named after the small village of Pez, the wine is rich and will age well. Drink from 2025."
"The 16th-century Scottish baronial-style chateau is surrounded by a 45-acre vineyard that gives structured wines like this. It has the richness of the year although it has not lost the ripe tannins and dark fruits. It needs to age, so drink this firm wine from 2024."
"A sinuous line of tannins runs through this structured wine. It lifts the dark plum and berry fruits and give shape to the spicy, firm wine. As the estate builds in strength, the style of this perfumed, stylish wine will be seen as a benchmark. Drink from 2025."
"Taking its name from the hill or Cos on which the vines are planted, this wine is dense and full of firm tannins. The fruit is there as well, ripe black currants waiting to come through the tannins. Give this wine time and drink from 2026."
"Under the same ownership as Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande in Pauillac, this estate has produced a concentrated wine. Dark and firm, with the tannins up front, the wine will take time to develop. Wait until 2025."
"This property, owned by the Cazes family of Lynch-Bages in Pauillac, has produced a structured wine. Its tannins show most strongly at the moment. Sustained by black-currant fruit, they will keep the wine firm although with a rich, generous style in the future. Drink from 2025."
"Cos d'Estournel has softened those austere Saint-Estéphe tannins and produced a wine that is all opulence and roundness. The tannins are certainly there, but they come through as big, bold richness. The power suggests it will age well, but for drinking earlier, the freshness of the sweet homemade plum jam promises well."
"Saint-Estéphe has a reputation for tannins, and this 2005 Cos lives up to that. But it does much more, because the tannins add richness along with intensely ripe black fruits, dark plums and figs. The dense tannins are finely balanced with fresh acidity, and a long-lasting aftertaste. Impressive."
"Boasts layers of wood, with black currant and rich white fig flavors, along with dried fruits. This is a ripe, opulent wine reflecting the heat of 2003 in Bordeaux, but still retaining dry tannins that promise aging."
"Despite the hot 2003, this keeps an impressive sense of balance with dense rather than superripe fruit, herbs, black currant jelly and delicious touches of new wood. Structured to age, with dry tannins and acidity. A great success."
"A lusciously rich wine whose opulence is tempered by some firm, dry tannins as well as crisp acidity. The superripe plum and blackberry fruits are open, generous and demanding to be drunk in the next 2-3 years."
"Dark, dry tannins are what good Saint-Estéphe is all about when young, and de Pez doesn't disappoint. But it does more, with refined black plum skin flavors, a rich mix of spices and mint, and a refreshing streak of acidity. In 4-5 years, this will be an outstanding wine."
"Grown in smallest of the so-called Saint-Emilion satellite appellations but within sight of Saint-Emilion's church, the wine is finely balanced and impressive. It has the fruit and the acidity of the vintage: ripe while also crisp with black currants. Drink from 2019."
"From an estate that claims to date back to Roman times and has been revived by the current owners, this attractive wine features dusty tannins and ripe, juicy blackberry-flavored Merlot. A touch of perfume and plenty of acidity at the end keep it fresh. Drink from 2017."
"Ripe fruit, sweet tannins and soft texture mark this wine. It's full, ripe and lightly structured. An attractive wine for its black fruit and forward character. Drink in 2-4 years."
"Saint-Georges is the smallest of the so-called Saint-Émilion satellite villages within the orbit of Saint-Émilion proper. This wine is on the light side, emphasizing fruit as much as structure, which is not to say it doesn't have tannins and some aging potential. Black-currant fruit and acidity make this wine. Drink soon from 2020."
"From the smallest of the Saint-Emilion satellite villages, this wine has swathes of black fruit aromas that go well with its firm tannins, dense blackberry flavors and concentration. Ripe Merlot dominates the blend, giving both structure and fruit. Drink from 2021."
"Ripe, elegant wine, with great flavors of black currants, plum skin sweetness and firm, etched tannins. Expect this wine to age well, the tannins rounding to give a wine of authority."
This impressive wine is full of black fruits as well as dark tannins. Its structure and density comes from the vineyard that abuts grand cru estates in Saint-Julien. The wine has power while as well as the elegance of the appellation. Drink from 2023.
"This ripe, sophisticated wine from a 27-acre vineyard is dense, structured and still young. Packed with fruit and tannins, it is one of the rare wines in the appellation not to be classified in as a Grand Cru. However, that means the wine is a great value and it certainly has the aging ability. Drink from 2023."
"Under the management of Jean Merlaut, this estate has lost some of the super-opulence of the wines of the 90s, and gained finesse and elegance. That has stood the 2003 in good stead, emphasizing solidity and dry tannins to balance the wood and cranberry flavors of the fruit. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"For a young wine, this is remarkably balanced. With fine but not powerful tannins and sweet black fruit flavors, it is polished, with vanilla accents and good acidity. It is already well integrated and should develop relatively quickly. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"One of the great estates of southern Saint-Julien, producing wines whose regularity in succeeding vintages is remarkable. For 2003, Branaire has produced a dark wine, with dry, powerful tannins coming from very ripe fruit. The wood is dry and toasty, leaving a general impression of a wine that will age at a stately pace. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This is a solid, powerful wine packed with tannins and heavy black fruits. As so often, Ducru is taking its time, and this wine is still knitting itself together. But in future years, watch for the generosity, the richness as well as the finesse and freshness. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"A dark, dry, brooding wine, which has flavors of blackberries and red plum skins,  which is not at all dominated by wood. This is a classic wine, with Saint-Julien's elegance and 2003's power. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"The most beautifully situated chateau, with its great view of the Gironde estuary, Beychevelle is another of those Médoc estates that has found top form after a fallow period in the 1980s and early '90s. The wine's generosity,  sweetness and fruit is balanced with the carefully crafted structure of wood that underpins it all. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"A huge, opulent wine that packs sweet, rich tannins and spicy fruit. In the midst of all this decadence, though, is a kernel of tannic dryness. This estate, long the weakest of the three Léoville wines, is now back in top form. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Somehow Barton has overcome the heat of the 2003 vintage and has come out with a new wine that is rich and elegant. There are generous tannins, ripe black currant fruits, balancing acidity, all in an ensemble that is so much more than the sum of its parts. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Pricey, but pretty darn good, with mint, chocolate and plum notes carried on a medium-bodied frame. Finishes long, with flourishes of black cherries and modest tannins. Drink now-2015. Imported by Royal Wine Corporation."
"This crus bourgeois has improved dramatically in recent years under the control of Jean-Louis Triaud. This 2002 is dense and dark, with solid spice and wood-driven fruit. At this stage, it is still tannic, but, for the year, is a powerful wine."
"A subsidiary label of Chateau Gruaud Larose, obviously destined for earlier drinking than the grand vin. Supple tannins frame cedar, tobacco and earth notes, while the light frame holds just enough flesh to avoid leanness."
"A second label of the famous second growth, Chateau Gruaud Larose, this wine offers charming scents of cherries, cedar and herb, but clamps down on the palate with dusty, slightly drying tannins that don't appear to have the depth of fruit to support them for long-term aging. Drink over the next few years with rare beef or lamb to help rein in the tannins."
"A solid wine, well structured, with soft but supple tannins that frame a core of blackberry, cassis, toast, coffee, anise and herb notes. The finish has a hint of sage and thyme, ending with moderate length. Good Bordeaux from a good year. Kosher"
"This is a very new-wood dominated wine, that will appeal to lovers of California Cabernet. Blackcurrant jelly fruits are there as well, very modern, very polished. It is a fine wine, but maybe not Bordeaux."
"If any wine could be described as beautiful, then Beychevelle is beautiful. Its flavors of liquorice and blackcurrant are smooth and opulent, well proportioned. The texture is rich, ripe and generous."
"Here is a huge ripe and luxurious wine, with great power. The texture is solid, filled with firm tannins, the flavors are black and ripe. Along with the power, though, is much of the elegance and poise that characterizes great Saint-Julien."
"Right from the early days of tasting in spring 2001, this was going to be one of the stars of the vintage. And a star it remains. There is big, ripe fruit, with solid, ageworthy tannins. It may not be as powerful as some of the blockbusters of the vintage, but it is certainly more opulent, less classical than Léoville-Barton can sometimes be."
"This is an excellent wine, full of ripe fruit and blackcurrant flavors, showing style and elegance in its balancing tannins. It is typical of this property in already showing signs of developing fast. Give it five years."
"Untypical of Saint-Julien, this wine is solid, chunky, quite foursquare. But it has good punch, richness and depth, along with concentrated black fruits."
"A very typical wine for the year, with its generous ripe fruit and blackberry jelly flavors. There is just a hint of animal on the palate, but this is overwhelmed by the rich texture."
"From one of the few estates in Saint-Julien that is not a classified growth, this wine represents a bargain. The wine is rich, perfumed and beautifully structured. It has a velvety consistency with its ripe black currants and generous tannins. The estate is named after the mill belonging to Abbot Bridane in the Middle Ages. Drink from 2022."
"The second wine of Château Glana in the prestigious Saint-Julien appellation is properly tannic with fruit in the background. The wine will develop well, but will still require some time. Its juicy black-currant fruitiness and acidity have power and concentration-enough to produce a ripe, while still elegant wine from 2020."
"This powerful wine has a superb mix of the crispest fruit and great structure. Blackberries and black currants shine through the tannins, expressing the liveliness of the vintage. It is so well delineated with everything in its place. The wine is certainly going to age for decades. Drink from 2027."
"This is a great wine. It has all the elements in place to produce a wine that will last for years: powerful fruit, rich tannins and a structure that is built to last. This is elegant, impressive and concentrated. Almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, the grape gives the wine its fruit and its tannins. Drink from 2028."
"Produced by the winemaking team of Léoville las Cases, this wine comes from a separate part of the estate. The wine, with its dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon, is dense with tannins as well as dark fruit. It is firm, powerful and a very fine wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2024."
"Firmly tannic and concentrated, this wine demonstrates how this property has developed impressively in recent years. It is certainly powerful, although managing to retain the Saint-Julien elegance. The blackberry fruits will develop well as it matures. Drink from 2024."
"Spicy, rich and full of ripe fruit, this wine has great potential. It is structured and dense while bringing out a stylish elegance. Blackberry fruit dominates the tannins to create a wine that has both concentration and fine fruit. Drink from 2022."
The wine is concentrated with tannins that come from both the firm fruit and the wood aging. It is packed with blackberry flavors that come through the structure strongly. The velvet texture (that is just a hint at the moment) is going to bring out the richness of this wine produced with consultation from Michel Rolland. Drink from 2024.
"This wine, with its massive tannins and rich fruit, is obviously set for a long life. It does have the contrast of fresh black-currant acidity to give it a lift. But with the power behind it, the wine will develop slowly. Drink from 2025."
"The second wine of fourth-growth Beychevelle is named after a 17th century owner, French Admiral de la Valette, who insisted passing ships in the Gironde estuary salute his riverfront property. The wine is a proper second wine, firm while also showing the way it will develop relatively quickly. Juicy black currants and generous tannins are balanced with acidity and a dry core. This fine wine will be ready to drink from 2021."
"Already well balanced, this firm, concentrated wine allows its fruit to show strongly. Dominated by juicy, black-currant-flavored Cabernet Sauvignon, it is solid while also fresh, layering tannins and acidity. The wine will develop quickly; drink from 2020."
"This impressively powerful wine has dense tannins and concentration. With 74%  Cabernet Sauvignon, it is firm, packed with black-currant fruits with intense, perfumed acidity. Cabernet Franc adds spice to the wine. The wood aging is still showing and the wine will need several years before enjoying. Drink from 2025."
"Firm and tannic, this dark berry-flavored wine comes from a specific parcel in the Léoville las Cases vineyard. It's full of tannins and structure, firm and concentrated. At the end, both tannins and tight black currants promise aging. Drink from 2020."
"This combines considerable power and concentration with rich, impressive fruits. It has both style and elegance, with density to give it great aging potential. The tannins are firm while also having a velvet texture. The wine, dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, is for serious aging. Drink from 2025."
"As a second wine of the chateau, it has some of the style of the top tier of the estate while being approachable. The tannins and perfumed fruit are already well in balance, giving a full, spicy and juicy mélange of black currant and red plum fruit flavors. Drink from 2018."
"91-93. Barrel Sample. Oak notes dominate this in wine, with spice, toast and vanilla tones hovering over fruit. There is a sense of over extraction that is luckily mitigated by lively acidity. It needs time to balance out."
"Despite the huge weight of fruit and accompanying structure, this is a stylish wine. It's impressively dense, concentrated and solid. At the same time, the juicy black fruits give a generous, full-in-the-mouth character. Drink this very fine wine from 2022."
"Huge structure, huge potential, a wine that will bring out all the fruit and density of the vintage while remaining very fresh. Black plums are already showing strongly along with the dry core that promises aging. It's serious while alive and bright. Drink this major wine from 2022."
"A ripe, fruity wine, it has tannins and structure as well, giving both richness and a solid, dense feel that will allow it to age. The aftertaste leaves juicy black fruits and soft tannins. Drink from 2015."
"With dense fruit and a powerful, complex structure, this is one of the best wines from this chateau. Blackberries, black plums and a rich, generous character are all here, along with fine tannins. Drink this great success from 2018."
"This is a really fruity wine that's opulent and gorgeously rich. There is a pepper edge, touches of new wood and a firm, dark core. Acidity and concentration are already integrated. Drink from 2018."
"Great swathes of fruit cross the tannic core in this impressive wine. Hints of wood aging peek out from beneath the sumptuous richness and spice. It is ripe, dense and obviously set for long aging. Drink from 2018."
"This wine, produced by the team of Château du Glana, is big, bold, solid and very firmly structured. With weight, richness, black plum skins and dark tannins, it's a fine wine for aging, so give it at least 6-7 years."
"A hugely powerful wine, full of dark, brooding tannins. It's a wine for seriously long-term aging, a sculptural vision of classic Bordeaux structure with with classy, ripe blackberry fruits. It has fresh acidity and an immense full-bodied character, cut through with mineral acidity. A great wine, with great potential."
"Attractively ripe, this second wine from Château Léoville las Cases is initially fruity. The structure comes through only slowly to reveal itself.The wine is ripe yet shot through with acidity. Likely to develop quickly."
"94-96. Barrel sample. This very ripe, full-bodied wine is powered by sweet blackberries and solid tannins. It is a full, concentrated and complex wine that has a great future."
"93-95. Barrel sample. Full of ripe Cabernet tannins, this is a structured wine that's chunky in character. It elegantly balances fruit and structure, resulting in a wine that's sure to be impressive."
"This rare unclassified growth from Saint-Julien has all of the elegance you would expect, and it balances firm tannins with a classic black-currant flavor. It has dark, structured tannins, with layers of wood and acidity on the fragrant finish. Keep this for many years."
"From one of the few Saint-Julien properties that are not cru classé, this nevertheless shows all the class of the appellation. It has ripe black-currant and berry flavors, laced with acidity and dry, dense tannins. Its richness  is still developing. This has considerable aging potential."
"A wine of architectural strength and classical proportions, this has straight lines that mark the packed, concentrated fruits, which are sustained by its tannins. This is certainly the best wine that Léoville-Poyferré has produced, sumptuous while so finely structured."
"This is a magnificently solid wine, initially even a bit severe. At this young stage, the tannins dominate, but it's also full of black fruit notes. Very dense and concentrated, this is a wine that's even better than the legendary 2005. The structure tells of its extraordinary aging potential: don't even attempt to drink this for 10 years."
"Densely tannic and rich, this is full of ripe chocolate and blackberry fruit. It is dark, brooding and dense-a great success for the second wine of Château du Glana."
"A beautifully structured wine, with its tannins layered between the ripest black plums, damsons and black currants. It is opulent while remaining dense, concentrated and very serious. Certainly a wine for long-term aging."
"Darkly colored wine, with flavors as rich as the color. It has opulent new wood and black plum fruit flavors, the acidity offering a succulent aspect as well as dense tannins and ripe power. It does need aging, but could well develop quickly."
"Very densely structured, showing the ripe fruit of St-Julien while also powering it with smoky tannins and wood. The acidity is a layer under the sweet fruit and final firm character."
"A deceptively approachable wine. Its gorgeous fruits are right up front, their ripeness powered by a generous, complex texture. There is concentration, but it is surrounded by so much richness. It can almost be drunk now, but should age well."
"Initially generous, the wine then becomes much more solid and dense. The structure is all there along with the ripest fruit. It is delicious and darkly tannic at the same time."
"An opulent, ripe wine from the ever-improving Beychevelle. It is rounded with new wood flavors along with just the right amount of tannin. Deceptively soft, with a solid, dry character behind the fruit."
"Initially wood dominates, but this is a stage after bottling. Because then the ripe, smooth fruit comes in, pouring through with black fruits, very ripe and juicy. As this wine develops, this rich fruit will be its main character."

"Smooth, open wine, the ripest fruit layered with soft tannins. It reveals all the opulent fruit of the year while offering medium-term pleasure."

"A very powered wine, pushing forward with solid, but always fresh structure and fruit. The wine bursts with ripe jammy fruits, but is also firmly tannic. It combines sweet weight with final extreme, exuberant freshness."
"A powerful, extracted wine, very concentrated. The tannins are dense, giving a sense of tight texture, while underneath the ripe fruits are pulsing with fresh acidity as well as sweet berry flavors."
"This is a great success for the year, a wine that is dense, characterized by balance between sweet fruit and solid tannins. Spice from the finely judged wood aging adds extra complexity, as do the plum and berry fruits. For aging."

"Impressively ripe fruit, with smoky flavors from wood, the texture sweet and fleshy. The wine has juicy berry flavors, with the freshest acidity, livened with spice from the fruit and the oak aging. Worth aging for 5-10 years."
"From one of the rare estates in Saint-Julien that is not a classed growth, this wine has many of the same perfumed, elegant characteristics as its illustrious neighbors. Restrained tannins show well against the ripe black-currant fruit and spice from new-wood aging. Drink this wine from 2024."
"This elegant, perfumed wine balances big fruit with some firm tannins. The juicy, clean black-currant fruit and good structure all promise aging. It will become a stylish, balanced wine as it matures. Drink from 2024."
"88-90. Barrel Sample. The intense use of wood is in danger of smothering the fruit in this wine. There is a hint of juicy acidity and black currants on the finish.  Although the fruit should develop, it is likely to remain tough."
"This family-owned estate has produced a structured and dark wine with great concentration balanced by acidity and pure, creamy fruit. It is a wine with a good future. The aftertaste leaves juicy acidity and firm tannins. Drink from 2025."
"One of the furthest west of the Saint-Julien estates, this property has been greatly improved with investment from Japanese owner Suntory. The wine from 2015 is dense and impressively concentrated, perfumed black-currant fruits working well with the crisp acidity and solid structure. Drink from 2025."
"This wine seems to be all about structure and tannins. The fruit comes through slowly and has a way to go in its development. But black currants are there, ripe and promising well for the future. Just don't drink before 2025."
"One of two classed-growth estates in Saint-Julien owned by the descendants of Henri Martin, this estate has been renovated and the results show in this well-crafted wine. Ripe tannins are balanced by smoky blackberry fruits and pure, clean acidity. Drink the wine from 2024."
"The ripe fruit that is a hallmark of this vintage at this estate has been maintained along with solid tannins and richness. This has both tannins and concentration although the fruit is the thing, making a wine that will develop relatively quickly. Drink from 2023."
"Sometimes seen as the junior of the two properties owned by the Barton family in Saint-Julien, this is an impressive estate in its own right, especially in this superripe, smoothly rich wine. Tannins are well wrapped in the generous structure and fruits. Drink from 2025."
"This elegant estate, with its views down to the Gironde estuary, has produced an excellent 2015. It is properly firm with tannins although this structure is well balanced with the ripe, stylish black-currant fruits and acidity. A juicy finish bodes well for the future. Drink this generous wine from 2025."
"This wine has a very toasty style, with spice and wood tannins that give an extracted character with some bitterness. That contrasts with the fruit that is developing, and it seems that the wood will integrate over time. Drink from 2025."
"The second wine from the Saint-Julien estate, this is every bit as elegant as the grand vin, its black currant fruit developing to envelop the fine tannins. There is fine fruit, plenty of acidity and a rich texture. It needs time, so drink from 2020."
"The tannins dominate this dark, brooding wine. At this stage, it seems to have closed up, leaving the fruit and acidity buried. But with this concentration, the future looks promising. There is a long aging potential here."
"This is opulent, but with restraint. The fruit is rich, black and delicious. Touches of spice and wood are present, lending complexity to the ripe fruits and balanced tannins. Impressive."
"Power and elegance merge effortlessly in this superb wine. Its pure black currant fruit is tightly coiled, supported by just the right amount of firm tannins. Great aging potential. A triumph."
"This is a marvelously complete wine, with its impressive ripe fruit, shining through the open structure. It is firm, but not too much. Stone black fruits are just perfectly ripe. There is just a core of dryness to compliment the rest of the wine."
"Although it is relatively soft, this wine still has everything about it. There is ripeness, but it is balanced with fresh acidity still with an aura of youth. In the core, there are solid blackcurrants, structure. It will certainly age, but drink over 10 years."
"A harmonious balanced wine, showing fine, fresh acidity. The tannins have closed in somewhat, but you can taste the chocolate, and the sweet character of the ripe fruit. At the end, the acidity gives a fine lift."
"There is a great link here between the tannins, delicious red berry fruits and blackcurrants and the almost architectural structure. The wine certainly has fine fruit, a great balance, very complete, finishing gently, ripe and soft."
"This is massive, hugely concentrated, topped with wood and intense tannins. Flavors of bitter chocolate are dominant, heavy fruits, blackberries and texture that fills the mouth with dark, dense flavors. Big in all senses."
"Impressively dense, dark flavored wine, very rich and quite extracted. But it still keeps the elegance and some of the freshness of 2004, and there is plenty of blackberry flavor to push the wine along. Heavier than many 2004s, it still shows that great acidity."
"What a perfumed, elegant, structured wine, with all the elements of fruit, wood, tannins just in the right place. It shows great tannins, powerful black and red berry fruits, denseness, and a classic, fresh aftertaste."
"The completeness of 2001, with its miraculous balance, is present in this wine. The acidity, ripe blackcurrants sit comfortably on top of dry tannins, the fleshiness of the fruit taking the edge off the tannins. It seems to bring out the structure, the fruit and the refreshing acidity of great Cabernet."
"A wonderfully firm, concentrated wine that walks a fine, balanced line between richness and poised structure. It is classic in the best sense, showing all the shape of a fine Bordeaux, while adding the extra dimension of the freshest of black fruits, complexity from a few hints of wood, and a dark, brooding, long-lasting aftertaste."
"A classic in development, a wine that will last for decades. It is certainly powerful, but already the shape is finalized, with its plums and berries settling down with perfumes, acidity, just enough tannins and a warm, welcoming richness. A great argument for the superiority of 2001 over 2000."
"Sweet, rich, dense, very much of its year. At the same time, there is the Barton touch that leaves some fine elegance, to go with the smoky fruits and richness, while acidity gives it a fine lift."

"This wine is ripe and full of fruit. Tannins come through strongly giving the wine good structure and good potential. Concentrated, the wine will develop well. Drink from 2021."
"Offers up decent aromas of sour cherries, then folds in leather and earth notes on the palate. This is an easy-to-drink claret for immediate consumption-little tannin, some coffee, tart cherries for balance."
"Lean and earthy, but clean, and with an appealing freshness. Cherry and berry fruit dominates, and the finish is true. And there's even some patented Bordeaux herbaceousness, but in a good way. Kosher."
"The wine, unusually 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, is ripe and juicy with some smoky tannins in support. It has a finely perfumed character although touches of extraction give it a bitter edge. That should blow by, leaving an attractive fruity wine."
"It's rare to find a pure Cabernet Sauvignon wine in Bordeaux, so this wine is definitely an exception. It is full of ripe black-currant fruit as well as the tannic structure natural to the grape. The wine has intense acidity as well as structure. It should age further, so drink from 2020."

"Bright, fresh wine with a light wood touch. The acidity highlights black currant flavors exacerbated by some greenness."

"This young wine is full of black currant fruit and balanced tannins. It has the richness of high alcohol, which brings out a touch of pepper. But juicy fruit dominates. Drink from 2018."
"Soft and bright with red berry fruit, this is a warm, open and easy wine. It has a gentle texture and just enough tannins to give it shape. Drink now."

Drink this concentrated wine from 2020."

"Malbec is on the list of allowed grapes in Bordeaux but is rarely found now because it used to be difficult to ripen. This rich, structured wine shows that the situation has changed. It's ripe, full of black fruit and likely to mature well. Drink from 2018."
"This wine comes from a small parcel of Malbec, a grape once common in Bordeaux but now rare. The powerful tannins show that Malbec can now ripen easily in selected terroirs, thanks to climate change. The wine is full, spiced with wood and firm with a solid structure. It will age further, so drink this rich wine from 2021."

This powerful, ripe wine from Tutiac's single-variety, single-parcel range should age, so drink from 2020."

"This pure Merlot special Cuvée is intense, rich and extracted. It has serious layers of spice and toast from wood aging. That lies over a solid structure that is concentrated and dense. The fruit is more masked and the bitter licorice character of the wine means it will take several years to come together. Drink from 2020."

"This wine has some richness. Full berry fruits are balanced by acidity and layers of tannins. The wine has good potential, exhibiting the ripe fruit of the vintage. Drink from 2020."
"Tight red currants and soft tannins give a wine that is bright and packed with fruitiness. The blend of 80% Merlot with Cabernet Sauvignon is lightly oaked, but mainly fruity. Drink from 2019."
"Firm, tannic and dry, this wine has some flashes of fresh black currant flavors, and a lift of acidity. It needs time to aerate before drinking, when it will have some freshness and lightness."
"Turns citrusy and tart on the finish, but this is a decent little claret nonetheless. Smells just right, with cedar, vanilla and cherries combining on the nose, then delivers a light, satiny-smooth mouthful of tart berries and vanilla flavor."
"This ripe, fruity wine is full of red fruit flavors. It has spice, attractive tannic structure and ample acidity. With its balance coming together, the wine will be ready to drink from 2017."
"Smooth and rounded, this wine picks up on the ripe fruit of the vintage and adds plenty of acidity and light spice. It is an immediately attractive wine, with fruitiness that makes it ready to drink."
"Fruity and lightly spicy from wood aging, this wine has black fruit aromas. It's lightly tannic, with just enough structure to make it an early-drinking wine. Drink now."
"This ripe, rich wine has solid tannins and still-young blackberry fruit. Although a basic Bordeaux, it is extra rich and extracted and, surprisingly, needs to age. Drink from 2019."
"This is a soft and easy wine from a ripe vintage. With black currant fruit, plenty of acidity and a light touch of tannin, it's made to be drunk young."
"This ripe, spicy wine shows indications of wood aging. At the same time it offers plenty of fruit, bright acidity and forward black-currant flavors. Made from two-thirds Merlot and one-third Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine has good potential. Drink from 2021."
"This powerful, concentrated wine has fine tannins and a rich texture. It is solid, ripe, full of both wood flavors and generous blackberry fruit from 90% Merlot. It is already balanced but will benefit from aging. Drink from 2023."

"Finding ripe Petit Verdot outside the Médoc in Bordeaux is unusual. And then to make an 100% varietal wine is very rare. It is a rich wine without being excessive. Its tannins and structure are firm, backed up by black fruits that will surely develop as the wine matures. Drink this success story from 2020."
"One of the exciting wines produced by this go-ahead cooperative in Blaye, this is pure Petit Verdot. Dark in color, packed with firm tannins and impressive black fruits, it is a wine to age for several years. Drink from 2022."
"Bold and ripe, this rich wine is concentrated and full of spicy black fruits. Produced from a tiny parcel of Petit Verdot that escaped the devastating frost of 1956, it is dark, dense with layers of blueberry flavors alongside the firm tannins. The richness of the wine and its weight promise good aging. Drink from 2023."
IToo much wood aging has masked the potential of the juicy black fruits of this unusual 100% Petit Verdot wine. It does have weight but that wood is overwhelming.
"Buying branded Bordeaux can be a risky business. But a few of the Bordeaux négociants make some good value brands that also offer decent quality. This is one of them. From the great 2000 vintage, it is ripe, lively and fresh, but at the same time has some depth of flavor with red fruits, a layer of wood and the acidity that makes red Bordeaux great with rich foods."
"This wine comes from a southfacing hillside vineyard not far from Pomerol. An unusual blend for Bordeaux, with 80% Merlot and 20% Malbec, it is fresh and perfumed, with firm tannins and black-currant flavors. Although it comes from the poorly rated 1999 vintage, it has good, ripe fruit. Like so many Bordeaux, this is a food wine, great with steaks."
"Weak cherry and cassis aromas are followed by dilute raspberry flavors. The finish is tangy and borderline thin, while the overall impression is sharp and tart. Despite all that it tastes fresh, not tired. Kosher."
"Dark in color, with a bit of lemony oak to the nose as well as chocolate and black plum. The palate is a basic Bordeaux mix of cassis, earth, plum and tree bark. The clean, smooth finish confirms the wine's ripeness. A good middle-of-the-road red for everyday affairs."
"Jean Chanfreau's family, which owns Châteaux Fonréaud and Lestage in Listrac, produces this blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, giving a wine with plenty of Cabernet cassis flavors, but also a roundness and spiciness that sit well with firm tannins. Lovers of young Bordeaux will find it ready to drink now, but it has a good five years before complete maturity."
"Aromas of maple, black pepper and cherry cough drop get it going in a fair to midland direction. The palate is basic, with only some standard berry fruit and oak, while the finish is lengthy and easy, but also kind of mute. In terms of mouthfeel, some hard tannins prevent it from falling into the ""friendly"" category."
"Green and underripe, with tobacco and rhubarb aromas. The flavors are too weedy and burnt for the wine to merit higher, and that's despite a perfectly good mouthfeel. Kosher."
"Horsey and heavy in the nose, with some cinnamon sweetness. The fruit is big and overstuffed, like plum pie. There's also a burnt flavor and potent acidity."
"Unusual for Bordeaux, this chateau's plantings contain 20% Malbec, imparting a strong blackberry character to the wine. There's smoky oak, too, and intriguing spice and juiciness on the finish. Imported by Bernard Magrez."
