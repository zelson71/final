"A ripe, balanced wine this is maturing well. It has a black plum note to go with the underlying tannins. Rich juicy flavors join notes of spice and wood, leading onto the firm finish. Age for another two years."
"Siaurac, at 153 acres, is the largest estate in Lalande de Pomerol. The 2007 shows the relative lightness of the vintage, but boosts it up with chocolate and dark plum flavors. The wine finishes freshly, but still with tight tannins."
"Broad tannins coupled with the berry fruits of the vintage have produced a bright wine with just the right firm structure. It is a rich wine, but also one showing elegance and restraint. That makes for a great wine for food, with a crisp aftertaste and good acidity. Drink from late 2018."
"A rich Merlot-driven wine, smoothly polished by new wood. Flavors of mint mingle with sweet tannins and black berry fruits. There is a fine, smoky edge as well to this wine, which would certainly benefit from 3-4 years' aging."
"This is the first vintage under its new owner, the American Stephen Adams. It's relatively soft, with black currant fruits, given a delicious lift by some tight tannins. The acidity gives freshness, a zap to the dry, firm finish."
"The estate belongs to the Borie family, one of the grand names of Bordeaux, with the wine making done by the team of Château Ducru-Beaucaillou in Saint-Julien. The result is an aromatic, balanced wine that is both structured and fruity. It has fine tannins, black currant fruit and a perfumed aftertaste."
"This wine comes from one of a group of wineries with vines in the small area north of Listrac called Le Fourcas. It's packed with red fruits and juicy acidity. The dominant Merlot gives a bold, rich texture backed up by the more structured Cabernets. It will develop quickly and be ready from 2017."
"This well-made, ripe and fruity wine has soft tannins that are already well integrated with the red-berry fruits. Acidity keeps it all fresh and suggests the wine could age over the medium-term. Drink from 2018."
"This Merlot-dominant wine is dark and dense. The dry tannins and wood aging give spice as much as fruit at this stage. A more juicy black currant-flavored element should assert itself with time, so drink from 2018."
"Often richer than its stablemate, Château Fonréaud, Lestage in 2012 also has more obvious wood aging flavors. It's big and concentrated, dominated by smoky tannins. It's going to develop into a rich wine, packed with blackberry flavors and always a dry core."
"A wine with structure, this achieves balance with its black currant flavor and acidity. It's lined firmly with tannins that bring a dry and texture to this solid, age-worthy bottle. Give it at least five years."
"At five years old, this wine is still young, with firm, extracted tannins still in place. They will not completely go, and this solid wine will remain densely structured. On the other hand, the black-currant fruit is there, adding a further element to the wine. It's a food wine. Drink from 2020."
"The 48% Cabernet Franc in this wine gives it a smoky perfume. Dry and still firm, the structure offers ripe tannins, hints of wood aging and fragrant blackberry fruits. The wine needs to age a little longer, so drink from 2020."
"Lussac is one of the so-called satellites of Saint-Emilion (villages that attach the magic Saint-Emilion name to their own). But it does have many attractive wines that emulate Saint-Emilion in every way except the high price. This wine, a blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc, with a combination of dry austere blackcurrant fruit and sweet tannins, has that evocative cigar box, tobacco flavor that marks out a good Saint-Emilion. It finishes dry, tannic and demanding either decanting or a few years' aging, but also ready to drink with food this holiday season."
"Dominated by Merlot, this is big, ripe wine. It still has the youthful tannic structure, but it also has so much good berry fruitiness. Rich, juicy with acidity and fresh black currants, it will benefit from some aging. Drink from 2016."
The 74 acres of Bel-Air have produced a firm while juicy wine packed with both tannins and ripe blackberry fruits. The structure and ripe Merlot combine easily and suggest good aging. Drink from 2017.
"A solid, structured wine, showing the fine tannins of the vintage along with ripe berry fruits. It has weight, acidity, without pushing the alcohol forward, remaining in balance. Age this wine for 3-4 years."
"While the wine has some richness, it is also firmly structured, with a minerally severity from its tight tannins. Under the surface, there is a fruity character that's dominated by a juicy black-currant flavor."
"This is a complex wine that shows sweet berry fruits, ripe tannins and new wood flavors. It is dense and chewy while also being full of rich fruits. This is a wine for aging, although its smooth character suggests it will age relatively quickly."
"This dense wine from the so-called Saint-Émilion satellite village of Lussac has plenty of the richness of the vintage as well as ripe berry fruits and generously integrated tannins. With plenty of black fruits at the end, the wine will age well. Drink from 2021."
"Ripe Merlot makes its generous mark in this rich, fruity wine. It has structure and dense tannins as well as juicy black-currant fruits. The richness is not excessive, accompanying this core of tannins. Drink from 2023."
"Taking advantage of the very ripe grapes of 2003, Bernard Magrez's winemakers pulled all the richness out of the fruit and into this intensely sweet, dark wine, with its black plums and fig flavors. The wood is all around this fruit, dense and spicy."
"A rich, succulent wine, full of ripe black currant and spice flavors, wrapped around a core of dry tannins. This is a wine that needs time to develop, but with its toast and other wood flavors and its weighty fruit, it should show well in five years."
"Cantenac-Brown has been tending to classic Margaux delicacy in recent years, but this 2003 is an exception. It is round and full of ripe blackberry fruits, with good tannins and is likely to develop well. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This chateau has a fine and deserved reputation, as this powerful but elegant 2003 shows. It has all the sophistication of Margaux, along with some lightness that balances the dry tannins. Imported by Vignobles De France."
"Brane-Cantenac's natural elegance, at the heart of Margaux, doesn't seem to have survived 2003 as well as some other properties, despite the initial favorable impression at barrel tasting time. That is to say that the fruit is very generous, juicy almost, but its ripeness seems out of proportion to the soft tannins and sweet aftertaste. Other current vintages, particularly 2001 and 2004, have been better. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Angludet is the story of an estate that has been built up painstakingly over several decades. The Sichels, whose family home this is, make very satisfying wines, which are always good values. The 2001, with its good structure, its black fruits and its sympathetic use of wood, has balance and elegance. Ripe fruits with tobacco aromas complete the package."
"Huge investment is paying off at Labegorce. And it has not resulted in a wine that is simply modern in style. For here the new wood is well integrated, the fruit is structured, and never too extracted, and the ripeness also has layers of Bordeaux dryness."
"One of the many Margaux estates under the control of the Lurton family, this is a classic wine, with dry wood and dark tannins, flavors of black currants and light acidity. There is no mistaking this as Bordeaux, with its serious, ageworthy fruits and tannins."
"Attractive, fresh flavors with ripe, red fruits make this wine very forward and immediate. It does lack some concentration, but the ripe fruit and delicate perfumes will make it beautifully drinkable in five years."
"This is not as big or as concentrated as many 2000s. But it has elegance and style, along with fine, ripe perfumed fruit and attractive, balancing acidity. Give this wine at least 8 years before drinking."
"This second wine of Labégorce Margaux is named after the former neighboring estate Labégorce Zédé that was amalgamated after the 2009 vintage. This is a ripe wine, full of the fruit of the vintage as well as having a firm dry tannic structure that will allow it to age. With juicy blackberry fruits still so youthful, it is going to be ready drink from 2019."
"The second wine of classed growth Rauzan-Gassies in Margaux is ripe, soft with touches of licorice, wood aging and spice. It has attractive, forward red-berry flavors and the tannins of the 65% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. It is ready to drink."
"Crisp fruit dominates this second wine from Durfort Vivens. It has tannins, tight acidity as well as the potential for further aging. Spice and wood flavors finish the wine on a firm note. Drink from 2018."
This wine is full of bright fruit and attractive acidity. It's been made to take advantage of the fruitiness of the year and is likely to develop quickly. Drink from 2018.
"Perfumed wood dominates this wine, giving it structure and tannins. Juicy red fruits are still submerged beneath this welter of dryness. The wine needs time to integrate. Drink from 2019."
"Like many wines from Marie-Laure Lurton, this is dry and shows its firm tannic and wood character. Here the wood verges on too much, giving an austere, hard character. However, the black currant fruit will come through, giving a dry wine that will have some richness. Drink from 2018."
This structured wine has firm tannins and a solid core of wood-aging flavors. At the same time it shows some of the style of Margaux with its balanced acidity and ripe berry fruits. Age until at least 2018.
"On the lean side, with a layered concentrated wood structure. The wine has weight along with dryness, although the fruit is harder to discern."
"The wine has weight, is warm and spicy, with bold fruit flavors. A fine wine from Angludet, it is ripe, the wood judiciously balanced, finishing with tight acidity."
"With its high wood flavors and aromas of mint, this sets out to be a modern, extracted style of wine. But it has the lightness of Margaux in 2007, the Cabernet tannins soft and open. It already has good balance, suggesting it is not for long aging."
"A wine that emphasizes the fruity character of the year, putting aside any missing tannins. Wood still dominates the fruit, giving spice and bitter chocolate flavors, but the green edge present in the futures tasting has gone, to give final cranberry and black currant freshness."
"A wine that has richness, with acidity, layers of spice and black currant fruit flavors. The dominant cassis gives elegance, and already a forward balance of fruit and wood."
"Piled high with new wood, dark-chocolate flavors and dryness, this wine will be a tough call for many years. It will show better, although the over-indulgent use of wood will likely always keep it dry."
"The second wine of Château Potensac, and under the same ownership as Château Léoville Las Cases, this is an impressive wine in its own right, packed with very ripe fruit, but still preserving the outline and structure of a solid Médoc. There is a wood element, but it is mainly the luscious black fruit that stands out in this wine. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"Although this youthful wine has obviously been in plenty of wood, it has the weight to reveal a promising future. So while the spice and toastiness are present now, they will soon integrate with the fine tannins and blackberry fruits. Drink this from 2019."
"From one of the estates owned by the Pagés family in the northern Médoc, the wine is spicy and rich with tannins and blackberry fruit. As a contrast, it is shot through with attractive acidity that is a character of the year. The wine will be ready to drink from 2019."
"A smooth and ripe wine produced by the team of Cos d'Estournel. It is full and rich with black-plum fruits and velvet tannins. With fine acidity at the back, it has kept its freshness. Drink from 2022."
"From vineyards close to the Gironde estuary, this estate has produced a bright and fruity wine dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon. That gives both a firm dry tannic structure and crisp black-currant fruit. The wine will develop over the next few years and should be drunk from 2019."
This is a lush succulent wine. It is full of ripe blackberry and black-plum fruits that are rich and superripe. Wood aging gives toast while licorice and bitter coffee flavors speak of some extraction. It is full-blown wine-sweet and juicy at the end.
This is a ripe wine that also has a light touch. That gives black-currant fruit and tannins along with a poised structure and attractive crisp acidity. The Cabernet Sauvignon fruit dominates while also giving the wine a dry core. Drink this stylish wine from 2019.
"This 16th century chateau with towers is in the northern Médoc. The wine is spicy with the wood aging still showing. At the same time, the ripe black-currant fruit is developing well and as it ages further, the wine will become finely balanced. With 60% Cabernet in the blend, this is a wine for the long term. Drink from 2019."
"With vines close to the Garonne estuary, this estate benefits from a warm microclimate. In 2010, that gave a high alcohol wine that shows weight and concentration. It is dense, developing its tannins and rich black-plum fruits well. The alcohol does show in a burnt edge which is the downside of this otherwise finely balanced, maturing wine. Drink from 2018."
"This is a ripe concentrated wine, full of black-currant fruit and dense tannins. The two balance each other giving a wine that has weight and a medium-term future. Drink from 2018."
"Aging in wood for 18 months has brought out the richness of this generous wine. It has black-currant acidity that is balanced by the tarry tannins and smoky character. Rich and now in equilibrium, this wine is ready to drink."
"Ripe and juicy, this wine is soft, generous and full of rich, while very fresh fruits. It has black-currant acidity, a touch of spice and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
"This is a rich, densely tannic wine with dark-hued blackberry fruits and ripe acidity. It is concentrated, still very firm while just beginning to show its full-bodied character. Wait until 2018."
"Rich, juicy and structured, this firm wine has great power and concentration along with a dark, dry core. It's almost too much of a good thing, very flamboyant and ripe. It still needs to age to be fully balanced."
"Unusually for the Médoc, this is a blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, rather than Sauvignon. That explains the lightly perfumed character of this full, still very tannic wine. It's structured and concentrated with a dry center and the potential of bright red fruits later. The wine needs aging, drink from 2016."
"With a dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this structured and firm wine has a dry, dusty character lightened by black currant fruitiness. The aftertaste, with its good mix of fruit and acidity shows a wine that's likely to be ready to drink from 2016."
"Richness combines well with the ripe blackberry fruits and acidity, producing a wine that's developing a full, firm character led by fruit tannins and just a touch of wood. It needs to age, so drink from 2017."
"Layers of new wood dominate this solid wine, giving a dusty, toasty, burnt character that needs to blow away. The wine though has the weight to develop well with its ripe, juicy black fruit flavors. Drink from 2018."
"Serious amounts of new wood dominate this still young wine. It has weight and there is great juicy black currant fruit underneath the dry wood character. Once it opens up again, this is going to be a delicious, structured wine. Drink from 2016."
"A rich, sweetly fruity wine, its ripe black plum fruit balanced by fine acidity and layered with wood. It is a solid and dense wine, firm and with great juiciness. Likely to age well for 4-5 years."
"Rich and smooth, this is a good example of the sumptuous 2009 vintage. It is soft, ripe with blackberry and red plum fruits. It is already developing well. It's a medium-term wine, already juicy and drinkable."
"Dark and extracted, this has firm, dry tannins. It's hard edged, but the potential of the black currant fruit is apparent. Give this structured wine at least five years for the rich fruit to surface."
"With rich fruit that is balanced by tight acidity, this shows both the structure and the fragrant red berry flavor of the vintage. The acids cut through the wine to shape its freshness, highlighting its dark tannins. It needs to age for 4-5 years."
"On the austere side, with a firm and dry tannic structure, this represents the classic style of Bordeaux. It has black currant fruit and a mineral edge, with a severe structure that demands to be aged."
"Initially dry and tannic, the wine shows dark fruits with blueberry flavors, smoke and spice. It is rich and dense, already with the fruit right up front. Drink now or better age."
"With spicy wood and mint aromas, the wine has ripe blackberry fruit, sweet tannins and some fine concentrated dark flavors. It is structured with a dry core of acidity and fruit skins. Ready to drink, but worth aging."
"This is a solid wine that has a mineral edge and some austerity. At the same time, it has weight that will stand it in good stead as it develops. Very dry, but with a streak of juiciness."
"This is a concentrated, balanced, sweetly juicy wine, benefiting from wood and ripe black fig and plum flavors. It has fine ripe tannins that support the freshly juicy fruits. Ready to drink, but will age over 2-3 years."
"One of a number of estates owned by the Pagés family in the northern Médoc, this property has produced a wood-laden wine, yet one that is also full of ripe fruit. Young at the moment and with the toasty character still prominent, this wine will take its time to bring out the potential of the blackberries and acidity. They are there and will be show best from 2023."
"With a high percentage of Merlot, this is a ripe, juicy and red-fruit-flavored wine. It is soft, with the tannins already well integrated into the plush fruit. This rich, generous wine will be ready to drink from 2022."
"This Bouey estate, with its historic 18th-century tower, is named for an ancestor. This wine is richly endowed, structured and with a solid core of tannins. The black-currant fruit around the tannins is balanced, ripe and likely to age along with the wood and tannic structure. Drink from 2021."
"With a blast of Petit Verdot in the blend (15%, not typical Médoc), this structured, toasty wine revels in its ripe tannins. It is packed with fruit, with a dry core that will allow it to age. Drink the wine from 2024."
"This is a structured northern-Médoc wine with good aging potential from Jean-Jacques Baudoux. With its tannins well in play, it has a dry core that is emphasized by the spice and toast from wood aging. The wine is likely to need some time, so drink from 2022."
"This is a rich wine, generous with ripe berry fruit. Produced in the northern Médoc, it holds equal quantities of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, giving both juicy fruits and a firm structure that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2023."
"This wine is ripe, juicy and packed with black-currant fruits. Its tannins and wood aging are playing a good supporting role. Generous and full, this juicy wine, from a 61-acre estate, will age well. Drink from 2022."
"This wine is firm, with a dry core that will take time to soften. But that will happen, because of the ripe black-currant fruit that lies underneath the tannic structure, giving a juicy potential to this rich wine. Drink from 2023."
"Fine wood flavors, balancing with black berry fruits, red plums and some soft chocolate and vanilla. The tannins play a fine supporting role, leaving the vivacious fruit, with its delicious juicy character, to have the final word."
"Rich black-currant fruits mingle with dusty, dry tannins in this young wine. A ripe, jammy character comes from the 85% Merlot in the blend. Fruity and lifted by acidity, the wine needs to age. Drink from 2021."
"From a vineyard dating back to the 15th-century, this is an almost pure Merlot wine. It is ripe, juicy and with a good balance between acidity and red fruits. The tannins are already soft, allowing the fruitiness to shine. Drink from 2020."
"The origins of this estate date back to a medieval Benedictine monastery. Today, the 29-acre estate has produced a rich-almost too rich-wine. Its jammy blackberry fruits are spoiled by the hint of pepper that comes from the alcohol. Still, the fruit is ripe and dense with a backing of firm tannins. Drink from 2020."
"Full of bright black-currant fruit, this wine shows its young fruitiness, backed by a dry core of tannins and ample acidity. With its structure and spicy wood flavors, it will develop into a complex, dense wine. Drink from 2019."
"Mint and eucalypt aromas set the scene for a modern, polished wine, packed with wood tannins as well as ripe black fruits. Currently, the tannins are winning giving a wine that is dark, structured and dry. So give it at least five years."
"Full and ripe, the wine's lush texture demonstrates the dominance of Merlot. It also has a dense, tannic character that pushes through the rich fruit, lending balance and aging potential. Keep this for at least five years."
"Ripe and extracted, this shows more of a bitter chocolate note than a fruit flavor. It has a very dry, firmly tannic character, with a dark, smoky feel. Powerful and concentrated, its pepper and spice tones accompany the note of black plum skin. Expect this to soften slowly over 4-5 years."
"Far too young to even consider drinking, this is a wine whose potential comes from its rich, round, concentrated black fruits and its dense tannins. It's chewy and chunky; age for at least four years."
"Firm and austere, this shows the structured side of the vintage. The wine has weight and rich fruit, giving it the promise of good aging. Give this at least two years to soften."
"Structure and ripe fruit go well together in this generous wine. Wood aging gives a toasty edge as well as flavors of bitter coffee and smokiness. Black-currant fruit is right there. The wine needs good aging, so don't drink before 2021."
"This small, seven-acre property has an unusually high (20%) proportion of Petit Verdot in its wine, giving it big color and structure. Ripe black currant fruits balance the tannins. Drink from 2018."
"Layers of smooth, new-wood flavors dominate this full wine. Dark chocolate and black plum flavors show the wood and the fruit of the wine. It's already concentrated and richer than many wines in the vintage. Drink from 2018."
"Ripe, full in the mouth and with a smooth, already silky texture, this is a generous wine. Its ripe blackberry fruits are juicy, while the tannins are soft and cushioned by the ripe fruits. This is a wine that will develop well, so drink from 2016."
"Made by the team from Château Chasse-Spleen, this elegant, smooth wine has deceptively firm tannins. The wine is dense, structured with plenty of juicy black currant fruits to balance. It will age, so don't drink before 2018."
"This 20-acre vineyard produces a wine dominated by Merlot, lending the wine a smooth texture. The wine is rich with ripe plum flavors and only gentle tannins. It will age well over the medium-term, so drink from 2016."
"This is concentrated, rich, full of blackberry fruits and layered with just the right balance of tannins. Chocolate and sweet fruits are given point by toast and an edge of spice."
"Deeply embedded in firm tannins, this is a wine for aging. There is plenty of mineral, black currant and plum juice fruit, with a fine juicy element as well as acidity. It is balanced and harmonious, a keeper for 5-6 years."
"Under the control of the winemaking team of Lafite, this estate is on a roll. This is a beautifully balanced wine, with complexity, richness and cassis, figs and black plums. It is developing relatively quickly, and will be ready to drink in two to three years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"A great success for this fifth growth, run by Claire Villars. The 2003 is velvety, rounded, beautifully balanced. It is not a densely powerful wine, showing more elegance and seduction. It is already developing, and should be ready to drink in four or five years, maybe less. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This chateau, owned by one of the old Bordeaux families, the Bories, has only recently begun to gain the stature its vineyard, in the south of Pauillac, demands. This '03 is still very tight, packed with dark, tannic fruits, and dominated by a dense layer of wood. The price is still reasonable, which makes this a great wine for drinking after 10 years. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"This Clerc-Milon, under the same winemaking team as Mouton Rothschild, is an attractive wine, not heavy, already quite soft. It seems to have been heavily extracted, in a New World style, with new wood aromas and flavors, losing something of Pauillac, but a winner in that it's immediately attractive. Imported by Diageo Chateau & Estates."
"On first whiff, it shows big fruit and vanilla, but it settles down on the palate to deliver cedary plum- and cassis-flavored fruit. Finishes long, with some dusty tannins. It's bulky and lacks a bit of grace, but it still makes for a satisfying mouthful of Bordeaux that should improve with time. Imported by Royal Wine Corporation."
"This wine has a distinctly herbal aroma and flavor. Sage, thyme and broccoli come to mind. The tannins are firm and frame secondary flavors redolent of coffee, plum and charry toast. Finishes with moderate length. Kosher."
"The French call this wine harmonious, and it is balance that gives it its charm, its character and its intensity. It starts with black, dense fruits and only half way through do the tannins kick in. At the end, the whole is greater than the parts, with acidity the last lingering memory."
"The younger brother of Lafite, Duhart-Milon exhibits deliciously pure fruit. The wine is deceptively soft, because under the black jelly fruits, there are also dusty, dry, firm tannins. At the end, though, it is the vibrant fruit which lingers."
This is a new wine in this ever-expanding series. It reflects the structure and solid tannins of the appellation. It also brings out the juicy black-currant fruit of the vintage that will allow it to mature relatively quickly. Drink this attractive wine from 2019.
"This blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot comes from a small parcel of vineyards owned by the Borie family, which also has two Pauillac-classed growths. This wine is neat and finely formed with crisp fruit and attractive acidity. The tannins give support rather than domination. Drink from 2020."
"A small portion of Château Peyrabon lies in the Pauillac appellation and is vinified separately. This is a surprisingly light wine for its appellation, fresh with fruitiness rather than structured. It has attractive black-currant acidity and a core of smoky tannins. Drink from 2018."
"After the promise of the wine at its initial barrel tasting, this bottled wine is less exciting. Berry fruits are muted by the extracted tannins. It's likely the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2018."
"This shows the lean character that comes from the vintage. But it's balanced with juicy black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that are now maturing. This is attractrive for a light, ready-to-drink wine."
"A wine that has freshness, some wood and a soft series of tannins, almost velvet. There is a stalky juiciness here, to complete a wine that offers the freshest acidity, with only hints of darker fruits."
"A concentrated wine, relying on its generous black currant juice fruit rather than the more reticent tannins. The wine is dominated by Cabernet juiciness, a burst of fruit in the glass."
"The second wine of classed growth Château Duhart-Milon. With its mint and herbal aromas, its rich velvet texture flavored with black plums and damsons, this is already a sophisticated wine that will be ready to drink in a year."
"From the same stable as Haut-Brion, La Tour Haut-Brion reveals a fruity, almost frivolous character that makes it immediately charming. But there is no question that the soft, rich, black jelly fruits are the mask for a more concentrated, tannic structure. Give it 5-10 years."
"The wine shows the firmly tannic structure of the vintage. It is dense, packed with dark fruits and dry tannins that are slowly developing. That makes for a rich, black-fruited wine, concentrated and needing to age further. Drink from 2018."
"While showing too much wood at the moment, this wine has potential. The red berries and black currants promise a fruity future with good tannins in support. Give the wine a few years and drink from 2019."
"The enthusiastic use of wood for this wine gives a dark, spicy character that masks any fruit. Less new wood would have helped highlight the natural fruitiness of the wine. Leave it until 2020 and the fruit may fill out. Winemaker Stephan Carrier returned from Napa to take over winemaking after Irish businessman Lochlann Quinn bought the property in 2001."
"This is a concentrated wine, full of blackberry fruits with acidity and spice. The wood-aging character is balancing out well, giving structure without dominating the fruit. Drink from 2020. Grapes are vinified by variety and plot from the 60-acre vineyard of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), Merlot (40%) and Petit Verdot (5%). The property was purchased by Jean-Christophe Mau in 2004."
"From one of the properties owned by André Lurton in Pessac-Léognan, this is a well-structured, wood-aged wine. Solid tannins and spice accompany coffee and bitter chocolate flavors. These are subsiding as the wine matures, leaving black currant fruits and a series of firm tannins that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2017."
"Firm and tannic, this is a wine that offers good fruit along with its dark exterior. It has a smoky character, while the dark black fruit promises to give the wine a lift into the next 4-6 years."
"Produced at Château Haut-Bailly, this concentrated red show the attractive fruit of 2011. It's tannins are relatively gentle, a fine counter-point to the red berry and currant fruits. It's a wine for medium-term aging over the next 4-6 years."
"Rounded and sweet wine, its tannins buried in the rich blackberry fruits. It is dominated by its fruity character, although there is a chunky texture that gives a firm mouthfeel. Ready to drink in a year."
"The Seze family has owned this estate since the 18th century, producing in 2009 a finely textured wine, one that has juicy black fruits and an elegant structure. It is a more structured take on the vintage, firm with dry tannins and acidity."
"While it is not a powerful wine, it is elegant, balanced, with density of flavor and tannns, freshened by fruit acidity and red cherry and black currant fruits. Like many wines from 2007, this is for the medium term, and can even be drunk now."
"Owned by Sophie Lurton and her husband, Laurent Congombles, who also owns cru classé Château Bouscaut in the same appellation, this estate has produced a richly spicy wine, full of toasty flavors. The fruit is still developing behind this barrage of wood, but will come through as the wine matures. Drink from 2023."
"With its high percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%), this gives an initial serious structure, topped with rich, ripe black fruit flavors. The tannins are calmed by this richness, with spice, blueberries and blackberry juice much more dominant."
"Dense, sweet fruit, offering as much elegance as richness. It is poised, with pure, elegant fruit flavors. As it develops, the fruit is going to become more and more delicious, while the dusty tannins will soften to reveal great opulence."
The wine has bold fruit and ripe tannins. There is still a strong flavor from the wood aging although this should integrate. The fruit is the dominant character of this red-berry flavored wine. Drink from 2021.
"All about freshness, this wine has crisp red-currant flavors and bright acidity. The tannins are just a background to the juicy, fruity front. Drink from 2018."
"This is a big, bold and fruity wine, packed with ripe Merlot fruit. Juicy blackberry flavors have a fine shot of acidity and soft tannins. It's a warm wine that will age well over the medium-term. Drink from 2018."

"Pierhem is a small property of four acres. In 2010, it produced this ripe wine from richly structured Merlot and perfumed Cabernet Franc. This is an impressive, plush effort, layering its chocolate and toast components over the full-bodied blackberry-juice note."
"While the wine does have considerable tannins, it also has the ripe Merlot fruit to support it. Good acidity, black currant fruits, smoky wood, all the elements are there. It will always be firm, but should mature well."

"For Merlot from Pomerol, this wine has a surprising austerity to it. The tannins are initially dominant, with their leather character. But then, the layer of sweet juiciness does shine through, giving freshness and some vibrant flavors. It needs time to knit together though-give it at least four years."
"For a solid mouthful of Merlot at a great price, there's no need to look further. Spicy blackberry and toast aromas add vanilla on the palate, before finishing with soft, ripe tannins and leathery notes. Drink now-2008. Editors' Choice."

"This dense wine is packed with firm tannins and concentrated fruit. A blend of ripe Merlot and perfumed Cabernet Franc, it has weight, with layers of black-plum skin flavors and dark tannins. With its firm dry core, it is still young. Drink from 2021."
The blend of 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc gives this wine a rich character. It does have a firm edge of tannins still producing a dry character that needs to soften. The juicy black currants are developing well and should balance the tannins in a year or two. Drink this solid wine from 2018.
"Richly endowed with ripe Merlot, this spicy, smoky, full-bodied wine is already developing. It is smooth, concentrated and deliciously juicy. Spice and firm tannins are well in the background, leaving room for acidity and black fruits. Drink from 2017."
"Aged in vats without any wood aging, this wine is exuberantly fruity. Ripe with Merlot, its blackberry flavors and generous fruit tannins are open. Acidity and the crisp texture at the end contrast with the full-bodied core of the wine. Drink this powerful, yet still crisp, wine from 2021"

"From an estate situated close to the vineyards of Pomerol, the 82% Merlot in this blend gives a sumptuous wine that will be ripe and full when it matures. The obtrusive wood flavors need to calm down first, so wait to drink the wine until 2022."
"This chateau shows continual improvement, and 2000 is a triumph. The wine is in a modern style, although at this stage its tannins are still firm and dry. Red fruit flavors and blackcurrants promise huge drinking pleasure to come."
"From a Grand Cru estate, this second wine shows the same rich fruit and generous structure as the winery's first wine. It's just softer with an approachable character and generous black fruits that will enable it to mature relatively quickly. Drink from 2020."
"The Figeac sector of Saint-Emilion has many estates that split off in the 19th century from a grand Château Figeac estate.

It will age quickly and should be ready to drink from 2019."

"A vineyard on the river plain of Saint-Émilion, Haut-Pezat has produced a wine whose full black fruits handle strong wood-aging flavors with ease. The result is a ripe wine packed with blackberry flavors and acidity that is filled out with the wood spice. The wine should age well, drink from 2020."
"This ripe, juicy and fruity wine has plenty of tannins, although they have easily integrated into the black fruits and fresh acidity. The wine is already surprisingly balanced, so although it will improve with age, it can be enjoyed now."
"Already balanced, this is a rich wine, packed with jammy fruit and tannins. The concentration contrasts with the intense, fresh acidity. Good depth of flavor comes with a dense texture and a final shot of pure acidity. Drink from 2017."

Imported by Acadia Imports."
"Meyney is often the most gentle of the great estates of Saint-Estéphe, and in 2003 this character is most obvious. The wine is full of vitality and ripeness, soft tannins showing the property more than the hot year. The fruit dominates right through the wine, with dryness only appearing in the aftertaste."
"A powerful, spicy wine that is dominated by wood and toast. The fruit is black but relatively lightweight, and is suffering at this stage from the strong wood flavors."
"Typical of  Saint-Estéphe, this wine is totally closed up. It is more tannins than fruit at this stage of its development. But it is obvious that there is fruit there, and that it will develop. But for now, it's a case of watch this space."

"A ripe wine, the wood a band of flavor through the sweet tannins and attractive fresh fruits. It has the lightness of the year, leaving the flavors coming from the bright fruits."

"This pure Merlot special Cuvée is intense, rich and extracted. It has serious layers of spice and toast from wood aging. That lies over a solid structure that is concentrated and dense.

"This so-called satellite appellation of Saint-íˆmilion is able to produce attractive, forward wines, like this one. The ripe, soft structure brings out the black fruits, rounded out by sweet juiciness. There is a slight edge of astringency, but then the smoky wood and berry flavors kick back in."
"Yes, it has 2003 ripeness, but there is also some restraint here. The tannins are still defiantly young, the fruit packed with black plum jelly flavors. It promises 2-3 years' aging."
This is the first vintage under the Barton (of Léoville-Barton) family ownership. It is a structured wine with some dense tannins and acidity. The fruit is behind the tannins and will probably leave a firm wine. Drink from 2019.
"This 19-acre property, in the same family since the 17th century, has produced a structured, Merlot-dominated wine that is as much about tannins as fruit. It's still young and all that juicy black currant fruitiness will blossom. Give it until 2017."

"A suave wine, concerned at this stage with its tannins and not with fruit. It is dry, the black plum skin texture just giving an opening to black currant fruits. All this means that this is a wine for aging-give it five years."
"This wine comes from a six-acre estate that belongs to the owners of neighboring classed growth Château Croizet-Bages. Get through the initial dirty barnyard character and there are density, generous tannins and black fruits. Hints of wood aging and juicy acidity are present along with a firm aftertaste.

"A finely made wine, with elegant fruit and tannins, but definitely on the light side. The red berry fruits are soft and juicy, already a pleasure to drink, with only short-term aging."
"Soft, juicy and fruity, relatively light in character. The tannins are fresh, supporting black currant and fresh, juicy fruit flavors. It's easy and open, developing well, but quickly."

This wine shows all the fruitiness that is characteristic of this attractive vintage. It also brings in ripe berry fruits along with a background of firm tannins. Drink this structured wine with its appealing fruit from 2019.
"With a high proportion (60%) of Merlot, this is a ripe wine while also being structured. It has a dense character that comes from the still young, firm tannins. Behind these are the ripest black-currant fruits, crisp and juicy, packed with flavor as well as acidity. Drink this wine from 2019."
"This is a big and juicy wine full of blackberry and dark-plum flavors. The second wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion, it is fruity with dominant Merlot and round and perfumed Cabernet. It is developing rapidly into an accessible, ripe wine. Drink from late 2016."
This wine is dry but rich enough with black-currant flavors to compensate. The juicy aftertaste suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2017. This wine is the latest result of renovations on the 15-generation and 400-year-old Trocard family estate.

"A small property owned by Château Carbonnieux, Haut-Vigneau has produced a serious while still fruity wine. Its spicy wood is attractive and gives a warm character to the cherry and red berry flavors. The wine will certainly age over the medium term, so drink from 2016."
"Big, fat and juicy, this wine has soft tannins and a full-bodied structure. It is full of the superripe Merlot that characterizes 2009, making the wine develop relatively quickly. It should be ready to drink by 2016."
"Made by the same team as Château de France in Pessac-Léognan, this is an attractive, forward wine. It shows the juicy character of the vintage, although the tannins do give it structure and some weight. A wine for medium-term aging: 4-5 years."
"Hugely rich, the wine has a density that detracts from the natural elegance of this appellation. Its tannins and extracted fruit are firm although with the potential of juicy black-currant acidity as the wine progresses. Give this wine several years and don't drink before 2022."
"An attractive, balanced, drinkable wine that is soft in texture, almost ready to drink now. The pure black currant fruits are fresh and bright, with light wood flavors."
"A serious wine, which still offers rich, powerful fruits. The aromas are of herbs and red fruits, the tannins are dense, with berry flavors, and the final effect is of great pure fruit."
"This is a firm, toasty and tannic wine that reflects its tough vintage. Made from 100% Merlot it has ripe fruit that was aged for two years in wood to give that spicy woody character. The fruit still needs time to enhance the rich texture of the wine. Drink from 2020."

"The second wine of Château Nenin wears its high alcohol easily. It is balanced, showing its dark tannins and juicy Merlot fruitiness in equal measure. It's by no means ready to drink, so age at least until 2018."
"A big, rich blockbuster Merlot, this has dark raisins and black plum flavors that dominate the background tannins. Its power comes from the superripe fruit and the concentration of the structure. Age for 3-4 years."
"There is lovely richness here, with fresh acidity and red berry fruit flavors. The texture is round, lightly chewy, with some wood and final stalky fruit."
"Relatively lightweight, the wine has soft, stalky tannins and flavors of hedgerow fruits to go with the well-judged layer of smoky wood. It is dry, firm and fresh."
"Bright, round wine, with a layer of firm mineral tannins, but more about black berry and plum fruits, jammy acidity and a finishing dry structure. This second wine of Vray Croix de Gay will be ready in 2-3 years."
"Rich, yet firmly structured, this wine comes from Christian Moeuix's home territory. It's no surprise then that it is a great expression of the appellation, a full expression of ripe Merlot, truffles, fruitcake, generous tannins and a tobacco-scented finish."
"Plenty of dense texture here, derived from a liberal use of wood. That gives spice to the black berry fruit and bitter chocolate extract. In two years, this will be showing well."
"A spicy wine, all new wood with plenty of toast. The fruit, however, is rich enough to cope, giving a mouthfilling wine, dense and sweetly tannic with a firm, ripe finish. Age this wine for another year."
"Using the ripeness of 2003 and adding to it by high extraction, the wine has moved from Bordeaux to New World. The fruit, which certainly has some attractive blackberry jelly flavors, has been overoaked, giving power and intensity."
"A dense, solid wine, still showing young fruit flavors, but with the toast from the wood aging there is a touch of burnt wood and spice. There's great acidity, fresh black currant flavors and some smokiness."
"A selection of the best Cuvées creates a wine that has some weight and density, although the extreme juiciness gives fresh black currant flavors. The tannins are present, but soft."
"From a 250-acre vineyard on the slopes of the Entre-deux-Mers above the Garonne river, this wine is silky smooth, attractively balanced with wood and soft but dry tannins. Flavors of dark chocolate, black plums and spice from the wood all blend together well. To finish, there is good acidity."

"Almost pure Merlot (95%), this wine is richly endowed with generous fruitiness as well as firm tannins. It's a young wine-all fruit and structure at the moment-and it needs to fill out. When it does, it is going to be a ripe generous wine. Drink from 2019."
"Produced from organically grown grapes, this wood-aged wine from the Dupuy family is rich and full, packed with black plum and ripe berry flavors. With 30% Cabernet Franc in the blend, the wine is perfumed and structured with a smoky aftertaste that is balanced by acidity. Drink this well-made wine from 2017. The vineyard was certified organic in 1996, early in Bordeaux terms, and is managed by Gérard Dupuy."
"This dense wine comes from a 50-acre estate, large by the region's norm. It's concentrated, showing signs of extraction although not enough to hide the black fruits and fruit tannins. Dominated by ripe Merlot, it will develop relatively fast. Drink from 2017."
"On the slopes above the eastern Bordeaux town of Sainte-Foy, this vineyard produces some fine wines. Aged in new wood, the wine is rich in tannins, complex and serious. Bright red fruits and a firm structure both promise aging. Drink from 2018."
"This wine hovers between being lightweight and dense. It's certainly mature, with tar and rose aromas, followed by spice and cigar box notes, and layered with acidity. Drink now."
"Initial big, tough tannins are then cut through with fresh fruits, plums and black berries. There is some spice here, and maybe the tannins remain hard-edged, but in 2-3 years this will soften out to give a big, bold, rounded wine."
"Perfumed with mint and wood flavors, this rich wine has tannins that show strongly against the red-fruit flavors. This suggests a wine that needs to age, so wait until 2020."

"This is Gérard Perse's home, and he has done wonders for a vineyard on the sandy plain of Saint-Emilion. With 2000, the property has shone, producing a serious, complex wine that boasts black fruits and solid tannins. The acidity and wood flavors give it shape and leave a delicious, lingering taste."
"Displays handsome aromas and flavors with a complex mix of plummy fruit, earth, mushrooms, violets and lavender, and dusty cocoa. Attractive balance with good body and texture. Blackberry and coffee flavors mark the finish, which sports full but well-dispersed tannins. Appealing now, but has some aging potential, too. Accessible, affordable, appellation-bearing Bordeaux. Best Buy."
"This producer, based in the eastern edge of Saint-Emilion, has these vines in the flat plain that leads to the Dordogne river. The wine has richness that comes from the vintage while also having structure and power. The juicy acidity and blackberry fruits are still developing, so drink from 2019."

"Strongly dominated by its wood aging, this is a toasty, licorice and dark-coffee-flavored wine. It does have some black-fruit weight that should allow the wine to balance out. So wait until at least 2019 before drinking."
"This is a fruity wine with contrasting wood-aging spice and high toastiness. It is still young with the acidity still prominent, so the two elements should blend well over the next few years to give a ripe, fruity wine. Drink from 2018."
"As its color indicates, the wine is approaching maturity. It has a rich texture with red fruits, some firm tannins and a generous character. With its spice, ripeness and concentration, it is fine to drink now, although the wine does fade quickly after opening."

"This rich, smoky wine has an appealing streak of ripe black-plum flavors. What it is missing in all this richness is enough acidity, although the tannins will certainly allow it to age. Drink this powerful, ripe Merlot from 2017."

"From one of three estates owned by the Moreaud family in one contiguous 61-acre property, this smooth and ripe wine is all about rich black fruits. Supported by just the right amount of tannin and acidity, it is already delicious and fruity. Drink now, but better to wait until the end of 2016."
"Set on the plateau of Saint-Émilion, this 12-acre property has produced a structured and firm wine. It is solid with tannins, dark with its black fruits and rich with superripe Merlot. Drink from 2018."
"This property was recent purchase by Château Ausone, but the 2012 was made by the previous owners. It has some rusticity and an earthy character that gives dryness as much as fruit. It should open out, but the wine will always be dry. Watch this estate for the future as the new winemaking team makes its mark."

"Produced from vines on the plain of Saint-Émilion near the Dordogne river, this is a Merlot-dominated wine. It has big tannins, bold ripe fruit and a dark core of dryness.

"A blend of wine from different Saint-Émilion vineyards, this is a solid, balanced effort. Rich berry fruits are sustained by the underlying dry, tannic structure. It is powered by sweet ripe fruits that are well finished by the fresh element of acidity. Drink from 2015."
"This is a big and ripe wine, with flavors of chocolate and blackberry. Dense tannins dominate, although the rich berry fruits and acidity promise a more fruity future. It's worth waiting; drink from 2018."

"The second wine of Château Chauvin is a structured, perfumed wine with its high proportion of Cabernet Franc giving much of its potential richness and spice. The tannins are solid and will always show well as an integral part of this complex wine."
"The wine feels very dense, juicy, dark and concentrated. It has a huge feel to it, a powerful wine that will need several years to fully soften and round it. And, At 15.5% alcohol, this is way too heavy for a Bordeaux."
"The tannins are firm and dry, producing a solid structure. A black currant flavor emerges slowly, offering a fruity counterpoint. Although the wine-named after the cedar trees on the property-is ripe and tarry, it needs another year or two."
"Big and densely tannic, this wine's fruit is still firmly buried in the structure. It has wood, spice and ripe plum notes. With its concentrated texture, it is still capable of aging."
"Some wood aging gives this Merlot-dominated wine a full structure, with attractive tannins and juicy black fruits. It is ripe, full-bodied and very approachable now."

"Ripe fruits, very smooth and polished, are primarily of a juicy black currant character over sweet ripe tannins. Great swathes of fruit finish this solid wine."
"Soft and full in the mouth, with spice adding an extra dimension to the broad berry fruits. The wine is ready to drink, its acidity melding well into the richness. The final taste is solid and dense."
"Firmly structured, this is a significant improvement on 2007, with the wood kept in play but not dominant. That's because the fruit is so bright, with juicy berries bubbling along, leaving refreshing acidity at the end."
"Dark in color, with a series of herbal aromas, this is dense and rich, with fine layers of berry fruits and solid tannins. It has a definite fresh character, with juicy fruit and acidity playing against the dry texture."
"The alcohol certainly gives the wine richness, but it manages to sustain it well, with superripe black plum and damson flavors, dusty tannins and a powerful texture that rolls richly around the mouth. It leaves a sweet and juicy aftertaste like old-style Rioja."
Over 90% Merlot from the valley below the hill of Saint-Émilion gives this soft and supple wine. Its tannins and smoky character are integrated into the bold black fruits and acidity. This rich wine will develop relatively quickly. Drink from 2021.

"While this wine still has the firm, tannic core typical of this vintage, it also has a mature character that shows it's ready to drink. Dry tannins and a ripe, spicy character mingle on the palate. Drink now."
"The second wine of Château Fonplégade is dark, brooding, powerful. There are sweet chocolate and spice flavors that  even manage to dominate the solid, ripe black berry fruits. Certainly rich, it misses the freshness of acidity."
"Still young, still forming its tannin and fruit balance, this is likely to turn into a strongly structured wine. The black fruits are in place, the dry tannic core is dense, and, at this stage, the acidity is prominent. Give it 3 years."
"Ripe Merlot pushes through the tight tannins that are still evident in this wine. This dark, dry core dominates initially, and needs time to open up to show the vivid black currant flavors, touched with dried fruits and fresh finishing acidity."
"It may only contain 15% Cabernet Franc, but that grape imparts its signature perfume to this firmly dark wine. The tannins are ripe, if dry, the richness full, and the red plum and blackberry flavors are elegantly exuberant."
"A dark, extracted wine, loaded with very ripe fruit and dominated by new wood. It is generally soft, maybe missing structure, but certainly a great wine for lovers of ripe, sweet black fruits."
"This third-generation property of seven acres is close to the village of Saint-Estéphe on the Pez plateau. Fruity and juicy, the wine is beginning to approach maturity. Its tannins and wood aging are still showing although they are beginning to be well integrated. Wait a few years and drink this wine from 2023."
"From a mosaic of 90 different scattered parcels, oenologue Georges Pauli has constructed a firm style of wine, with Saint-Estéphe's characteristic tannins and fresh black currant fruits. This is a structured wine, which should certainly age well. Imported by Fruit of the Vines, Inc."

"Firmly structured, this dark and dense wine packs a punch of tannins, giving a dry core. The judicious wood-aging supports the black-currant fruitiness that is developing well. It should be ready to drink from 2017."

"Saint-Georges is the smallest of the so-called Saint-Émilion satellite villages within the orbit of Saint-Émilion proper. This wine is on the light side, emphasizing fruit as much as structure, which is not to say it doesn't have tannins and some aging potential. Black-currant fruit and acidity make this wine. Drink soon from 2020."
"Pricey, but pretty darn good, with mint, chocolate and plum notes carried on a medium-bodied frame. Finishes long, with flourishes of black cherries and modest tannins. Drink now-2015. Imported by Royal Wine Corporation."
"This crus bourgeois has improved dramatically in recent years under the control of Jean-Louis Triaud. This 2002 is dense and dark, with solid spice and wood-driven fruit. At this stage, it is still tannic, but, for the year, is a powerful wine."
"A very typical wine for the year, with its generous ripe fruit and blackberry jelly flavors. There is just a hint of animal on the palate, but this is overwhelmed by the rich texture."

"Bordeaux has always had Malbec in its vineyards although it is rare. This unusual wine shows how, in a fruity year, the grape can work well. The tannins are soft, giving a juicy black-fruited wine that is forward and delicious to drink now for its succulent fruit."
"Malbec is on the list of allowed grapes in Bordeaux but is rarely found now because it used to be difficult to ripen. This rich, structured wine shows that the situation has changed. It's ripe, full of black fruit and likely to mature well. Drink from 2018."
"This is a rich wine, full of juicy fruit and attractive acidity. A blend of 95% Malbec and 5% Merlot, it has touches of wood aging along with the tannins. It will develop quickly, so drink from 2018."
"This is a jammy wine, produced in a clay amphora. It is full of the extra-ripe fruit typical of the vintage. However the wine works because the tannins are not excessive, giving space to the red-berry flavors and just enough acidity. Drink this wine from 2020."

Owner Thierry Valette's family also owns Château Troplong-Mondot in Saint-Émilion."

"There was probably too much new-wood aging for the fruit of this wine. It is still very dry, masking the potential of the rich blackberry flavors. Maybe things will come together, in which case wait until 2021."
"This rich wine has some firm tannins as well as generous black fruits. It is balanced, with the crisp acidity coming through strongly. Pepper and pure fruit flavors finish this attractive wine."

"A rich but structured wine, this shows dark fruits and a strong tannic core. There is fine acidity and a taut, mineral texture."
This fruity wine is young and full of black-currant flavors. The wine still has a stalky character that will soften. This is going to be a crisp while also structured wine. Drink from 2018.

"This blend of hand-picked 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc is still tough with dark tannins and a black plum-skin texture.

"There are very firm, dry tannins here, and they will likely always be with the wine. That said, it has a certain weight of fruit, fresh currant skins and a final cranberry acidity. It really needs food."
"Aging this wine in 100% new wood has left it very dry, the fruit tight and black but oddly drained of richness. There is sweetness along with prune flavors. But the tannins may never soften enough."
"A firmly tannic wine that has a core of dryness surrounded by blackberry juice fruits. The acidity is tamed but present, fitting well with the solid center. For possible aging over 2-3 years."

"A fine, ripe wine, creamy toast coming through the red fruits and light tannins. It is already well developed, not a wine for aging, but it is delicious to drink now, very fresh, juicy."

"With 24 acres, this is a small estate planted to 90% Merlot. In this vintage, while the structure is all there, the wine also has a big, ripe luscious, blackberry character that will come out over the next months. The aftertaste is ripe and full in the mouth."
"Just like this wine has lost its initial red color, so too has its flavor changed. Now maturing fast, it conveys flavors of leather and acidity along with a dry edge that may be a sign of age. It's delicious, but drink the wine now."
"This ripe, rich and Merlot-dominated wine comes from the western section of Lalande de Pomerol. Juicy black-fruit flavors are lifted by acidity and given structure by the firm wood-aging texture. The wood needs to integrate with the fruit, so drink from 2018."
"Ripe and fruity, this is an obviously wood-aged wine. The spice and toast need to calm down and integrate better into the rounded, generous black fruit flavors. With all the elements in place, it just needs time. Drink from 2018."
"This is a very dark wine, rich in dried fruits, plums and dense tannins. The wood aging is an important element here, giving a firm and dry character. With its richness comes weight and concentration. A bitter edge suggests overextraction."
"This blend dominated by Merlot is still firm and solid, with bitter tannins and and dark chocolate flavors from hard extraction. From a selection of old vines, it's concentrated and will need aging. Drink from 2021."
"With 44% of Cabernet Sauvignon and an equal amount of Merlot, this wine perfectly expresses the relatively cool vineyards of Listrac. It has structure, tautness and fine, violet perfumes and layers of spicy wood. Fine, clean acidity suggests good aging potential. Imported by Carolina Wine Co."
There is plenty of Merlot in this ripe wine which is produced in the Listrac cooperative. Spice and attractive tannins give the wine structure and perfume. They contrast with the juicy blackberry fruits and fine crisp acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from 2021.
"Named after the outcropping of gravel on which the vines are planted, this second wine of Fourcas-Dupré is Merlot-based. With its smoky tannins and strong flavors of wood, it needs to fill out with the blackberry fruits that lie in the background. That won't take long and the wine will be ready to drink from late 2016."
"One of Bordeaux's more memorable labels (orange nymphs supporting a picture of the chateau), Saransot-Dupré is one of a number of chateaus in Listrac with the Dupré suffix. This is a solid wine, chunky in a typical way for the appellation with plenty of black fruits and balanced tannins. Drink from 2017."
"This concentrated, structured wine has an earthy quality, typical of some Listracs, along with a more juicy, fruity character that's boosted by acidity. Balanced, it will age over the medium-term. Drink from 2017."
"Here's a big, smooth, round wine, with tannins that are packed into the superripe fruit flavors. It is powerful and concentrated, and the wood influence is still prominent along with a touch of bitterness from overextraction. It needs time to fully integrate."
"With the rough edges and firm tannins of Listrac, this is a wine that will likely always be firm. Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, it has a black currant skin flavor, some wood influence and a dry texture. It may not age further, always staying tannic and solid."
"The hot, overweight 2003 vintage has not been kind to this licorice- and dark chocolate-flavored wine. It is dry, firm, while still garishly rich. If you have it, drink it now."
"The entry-level wine from this estate, this is soft and full of ripe strawberry flavors. Its light tannins and fruitiness go with a succulent texture to make a wine that is ready to drink."
"With its aromas and flavors of plum and leather and subtle hints of vanila, this is a supple, medium-weight Bordeaux that's ready to drink. No, it's not that intense or complex, it's just a pleasing mouthful of claret."
"Dominated by 80% Merlot, this ripe and firm wine is full of red berry fruits with a solid, dry core that comes from the fruit tannins. The tannins are still young, still solid, so the wine even with its fruitiness needs to age. Drink from 2016."
"This wine is maturing well, giving a firm, structure and some stalkiness. It's dry and will remain that way, showing some mineral texture as well as black currant flavors. The wine will be at its best in 2015."
"A big rich, well-made wine that comes from Soussans in the north of Margaux appellation. It is solid, with some new wood flavors, black fruits and tarry tannins that leave a firm, dry aftertaste."
"A well-flavored, well-structured wine, which emphasizes Margaux elegance. Flavors of black currant, Mediterranean herbs and spices are all harmonious. It may not be a big wine, but it has richness, light tannins and good intensity."
"A ripe, juicy and forward wine, this is all fruit-but it's delicious fruit. The tannins are restrained behind the exuberant fruitiness. It may not be classic Bordeaux, but it is likely to be very drinkable in 2-3 years."
"This Margaux is full of firm tannins that parallel the fragrant blackberry and black plum touches. It has a dense structure, very much in line with the year, while the finish is juicy and fruity."
"A soft juicy wine, with mid-weight. The berry fruits, the black currant juice and the fresh acidity are enjoyable. It's developing fast, and not likely to age."
"As sometimes with Angludet, there is a rusticity to the tannins that brings down the fruit. The freshness, though, is there, an attractive bright berry character, spiced with cinnamon."
"This wine is a selection from the Castera estate. The high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon gives it black-currant fruits and fine tannins. Rich and still young, the wine will age well and should be drunk from 2022."
"A small, 17-acre property near Saint-Laurent in the north of Medoc, this is a classic Bordeaux, with its tight tannins, layers of dryness and acidity. But these are not negatives because this is a delicious food wine, one that also has great black fruits. Imported by Victoire Imports."
"From the great 2000 vintage, this is suitably deep, impressive wine. Wood and vanilla aromas show through to taste with sweet blackcurrants, some sweet jelly flavors, balanced with a big, long-term aging structure. Magnol is a property in the southern Médoc, owned by Barton & Guestier."
"Named after the stagecoach stop just outside the chateau, this is a crisp wine, still underlined with wood, although with plenty of attractive black-currant acidity and fruit flavors. It will be ready to drink from 2020."

"A half-and-half blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon has yielded a plush wine that also has firm tannins. With its juicy blackberries, acidity and wood aging, the wine is set for slow aging. Drink from 2020."
"This is a bright and fruity wine from a blend of 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Black-currant fruit and a touch of spice from wood aging leave a wine that is juicy, packed with fruitiness and likely to be ready to drink soon. D0rink from 2019."
"The wine is ripe, weighty and full of fruit. Its tannins are already softening into the blackberry flavors. The sole question about this wine is the excessive wood aging that has given a burnt edge. Hopefully, this blend of 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot will assert its natural fruitiness. Don't drink before 2020."
"This wine with its tight black-currant character, is still also firm with tannins. It has a juicy edge that will develop well as the wine matures. With crisp acidity and structure, it should age. Drink from 2018."
"This is a ripe wood-aged wine. It has tannins and layers of spice and toast from the wood aging. Happily, the fruit is also there, giving well-balanced black currants and acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from 2020."
Equal proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot give this wine a ripe character. The wood aging shows in the smoky flavors that underline the juicy black-currant fruits. The wine is attractive and will soon show its fruitiness. Drink from 2019.
"A fruity wine full of red-berry flavors. This fruitiness is balanced by the light tannins and juicy acidity, producing a wine that is ready to drink."
"Produced from 40-year-old vines with Merlot dominant in the blend, this is a dark wine showing tight black-currant fruits and crisp acidity. With its texture and dry tannins still prominent in its youth, the wine needs to age so drink from 2018."
"This ready-to-drink wine offers fresh black-currant flavors and a streak of tannins. It has spice, fresh acidity and a bright aspect. The wood-aging has smoothed out the stalky fruits and given the wine some extra richness. Drink now."
A hint of stalkiness to the black-currant fruit in this wine contrasts with the fresh acidity and light tannins. It's a wine with plenty of fruit that will mature quickly. Drink from 2017.

"This structured, tight and still-young wine comes from vineyards in the northern Médoc. With enough weight to promise aging, it is layered with stalky black-currant flavors and firm tannins that need to soften. Underneath, there is the potential for juicy fruitiness and balanced structure. Drink from 2018."

"Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit. That solid structure suggests the wine will need time to develop. The aftertaste boosts a more juicy fruitiness."
"It's a shame so much high-toast wood was used in aging this wine. Under those flavors of smoky wood, some black fruit wants to come out. The wine does have the weight, and it will be worth waiting until 2018 before drinking."
"Fifty-year-old vines are the backbone to this firm wine. Mint and smoky wood-aging flavors give a dry, dense character. Underneath the Cabernet tannins and black currant fruit are developing well. This is a wine for the medium-term, drink from 2017."
"Fruity, soft and ripe, this is almost ready to drink. Attractive berry fruits are touched by a smoky character from the wood aging. Balancing Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot equally, the wine has ripe tannins and a gentle, juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2016."
"While the wood aging of this wine still shows, it's already balancing out with the ripe black fruits and rich structure. An attractive smoky character is followed by juicy berry flavors and acidity. This is a wine to age, so wait until 2017."

"This ripe, now soft wine has gentle red fruits and soft acidity. It's ready to drink with its rich texture and smooth structure. The end is rounded, only just hinting at tannins."
"This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time to develop, although it will give the wine density and ripe berries in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017."
"An elegant wine, it has both fine structure and dense red berry fruits. The ensemble is balanced, rich while not overpowering. Drink this wine from 2016."

"Still showing its wood aging, this is a complex and ripe wine. It has weight, ripe berry fruits and juicy acidity, all supported by a firm, dry tannic structure. It's a wine for medium-term aging, so drink from 2016."
"This perfumed wine is split equally between Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Its tannins, already softening, support a juicy, black currant flavor, with fine acidity and a texture that only needs medium-term aging. Drink from 2016."
"A gently perfumed wine, it has ripe, juicy black-fruit flavors and a backing of tannins. It's balanced with the dry core surrounded by rich fruitiness and a burst of final acidity. It could be drunk now, but will be better from 2016."
"This is a bold, ripe and fruity wine. It has rich black currant fruits, solid tannins and a dense texture. Very aromatic, it is powered by its dry core that is showing signs of softening and rounding out. Drink from 2017."
"A fruity and juicy wine, it also has a stalky, herbal element. That gives a fresh character to the wine while also showing lightness. The black currant fruits are strong and forward, with a hint of maturity that suggests this is for medium-term aging."
"Showing considerable wood flavor, this wine has some tough tannins to overcome before it really shows its best. The fruit is ripe, full and packed with blackberry flavors. Once fully integrated, the wine should reveal more of a luscious side. Drink from 2017."
"Big, bold and very fruity, this is a black-currant-dominated wine. It's full of broad brush strokes of acidity and spice from wood aging. Still young, it needs to be aged. Drink from 2016."
"Showing the richness and structure of the 2010 vintage, this is an opulent wine, full of black fruits. It has a dark structure, smoky bacon flavors and powerful tannins. Ripe and generous, the fruit can cope with this structure. It does need to age, so drink from 2017."
"Already an easy, ripe wine, this is fruity, rich and developing well. Its black currant and berry fruits give a sense of freshness, while smoky tannins suggest structure. It's not powerful, but will be very enjoyable. Drink from 2017."

"This is a juicy black-currant flavored wine that's ripe in tannin and in fruitiness. It has a hint of bitter extraction and an edge of dark wood aging, which need to soften and become round, so age it for at least five years."
"New wood aromas and flavors make this selection seem dominated by toast, giving it a dry, tannic character. The ripe plum fruit is submerged and is likely to surface only after 3-4 years of aging when a powerful, upfront wine will emerge."
"An ancient staging post for the coaches that plied the Médoc, Patache d'Aux is now producing some fine rich wines with a sense of structure as well as fruit. This 2010 has full, sweet-tasting red fruit flavors, with firm tannins that promise to age over the next 3-4 years."
"A blend of equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is already a well-balanced, ready-to-drink wine. It has dusty tannins suspended easily in the black currant flavor, while the dry core brings weight. Drink now or age for two years."
"While the aromas speak of wood aging, the fruit comes through on the palate. It is firm, full and dry, and the fruity acidity and fresh black currant flavor backs up the structure."
"Pushing forward the acidity of Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a structured and freshly fruity wine, full of black currant flavors as well as red berry fruits. There is a dry core here from wood aging. The fruit gives a delicious buoyancy to the aftertaste."

"Wood-dominated wine, very structured. It is spicy, firmly dry, with juicy black currant fruit behind the wood. Give a year or two for the wood to soften out and the fruit to come forward."
"A rich wine laden with juicy blackberry fruits and wood tannins, lapping up the ripe vintage. Soft and ready to drink."
"Although initially austere, the wine opens up to give firm, dry tannins and black berry juice fruits, balanced with tobacco. It is restrained at this stage, the fruit not quite bursting into life. Wait for 2-3 years."

"Pierced with acidity, this has intense black currant fruits and some smoky bacon flavors from the wood aging. It is firm, dry, concentrated, although not yet fully expressive."
"At first taste, the tannins dominate. Then fresher fruit shows through. The wine is firmly dry, the texture linear, the fruit showing some black currant character."

"Offering attractive black-currant fruit, this wine is crisp as well as structured. Layers of tannins, berries and acidity are coming together well as the wine matures. Drink from 2022."
"From a chateau owned by the Bouey Bordeaux negociant family, this wine is ripe, rich and soft. Its tannic structure gives just-enough support to the attractive red-currant and berry fruits. Drink this forward, fruity wine from 2020."
"This small 12-acre property has a high proportion of Merlot in its blends. Still packed with high-toast wood flavors, this wine has a future, with plenty of ripe red-berry fruits and a generous texture. Wait for the wood to dissipate and for the fruit to come forward."
"This wine is rich, with superripe tannins and a barnyard character. It has structure but it mainly focuses on fruit and acidity. Made by the team at Cos d'Estournel, the wine has a rich structure and will be ready to drink soon, from 2019."

"A structured wine that gives pleasure from its ripe blackberry fruits as well as from its firm, food-friendly, spicy tannins. It has vibrant, vivid acidity that lifts the dense structure and gives an elegant feel to the close."
"A wood-laden bottling, produced from a selection of wines at Patache d'Aux. If the wood weren't currently so dominant, the blackberry fruits would have more of a chance. It obviously needs a year or two to smooth out and come into balance."
"This wine comes from an estate owned by the same family for four generations. Dark in color and rich with generous fruit and spicy tannins, the wine is open, smoothly textured and likely to develop quickly. Drink from 2020."
The wine is tight with considerable tannins over the black-currant fruit. That makes for a structured dark wine with black-plum skins giving a firm texture. The wine will need time. Drink from 2021.

"The wine, with 70% Merlot in the blend, is soft with gentle open tannins. It has an attractive perfumed edge. It's a light wine, fruity and ready to drink."
"A fruit-dominated wine, full of sweet, ripe, juicy flavors. It is not complex, but its richness in this vintage is going to make it very drinkable in five years."

"Spicy and soft, this is an easy wine, fruity and showing the freshness of the vintage. It does have a background of smoky tannins that balance the fruitiness of the wine."
"Fresh and juicy, with bright acidity and some solid tannins. Flavors of spice accompany an edge of green fruit. The aftertaste is tannins and wood."
"While this wine has pleasant fruit, there are also some dark edges of black berries and rough tannins. The focus is shaded, still developing."
"Showing, coffee and sweet juicy fruit, the wine has a light touch, freshened with acidity and strengthened lightly with tannins. There is a meaty character, but the wine does finish a little hollow."
"Big, fruity and softly structured, this is a fresh, juicy wine with a fine tannic element. The  black currants, black plum skin tannins and vibrant acidity pair with a dry center that gives balance."
"José and Brigitte Rodrigues-Lalande are gung-ho on Pessac-Léognan. This ripe wine is ready-to-drink, full of black-currant fruit, spice and well-integrated tannins. With its balanced acidity, it is ripe and smoky with a crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
"A well-balanced wine with dry fruits, flavors of black currants and fine, fresh fruit. It is not a big wine, but benefits from elegance and freshness. It is ready to drink now."

"A wine on the lean side, relatively light, with tannins tight and firm. It has some initial easy berry flavors, but they are followed by a dry aftertaste."
"This small, 17-acre Pomerol vineyard is the only biodynamic one in the appellation. With this 2001, the Laval family has produced an intense, chocolaty Merlot (with 25% Cabernet Franc), full of smoky coffee, dark red fruits and plum flavors. Expect this wine to age over 5-10 years. Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections."
"This wine is tight and stalky with strong Merlot tannins and a feeling of firm extraction. The acidity is very present as is the dry, tight character. Still young, the wine needs to age and perhaps soften over the next five years. Drink from 2019."
"A ripe, fruity wine, dominated by sweet Merlot with a complex layer of high spice wood flavors. The wine is rich and generous, but certainly needs to integrate its wood. Drink from 2016."
"Dry tannins from the old wood give this wine a hard edge at first. Fresh, juicy red fruits offer an enticing character. On the finish, the tannins are tough and will need several years to soften"
"New wood influence and extraction give the wine a bitter edge, and a dark chocolate flavor dominates. It has a core of ripe black fruit that will round out as it develops. Solid, chunky, firm and dense."
"A dark, dense wine, still very young, but already supple. Merlot was ripe in 2004 and this wine shows it in its opulence and richness. Yet there are tannins here, so drink now, and age over the next 5 years. A great value for a Pomerol."
"This has pure, black currant fruit aromas and flavors, and wood and acidity on the palate. It is packed with fresh, vibrant fruit. Imported by William Grant & Sons."
"It's rare to find a 10-year old Bordeaux just arrived in this country. This now mature wine is full and rich, its weight coming from spice and textured tannins that are laced with acidity. It is initially dry, but does open out to give a juicy, if mature, character but is unlikely to age."
"Soft wine, dominated by wood spice and tannins. It has weight, which suggests the juicy fruit will show through after a year. Age for 3-4 years."
"Very smooth and soft, this is an interpretation of Bordeaux that left out the tannins. But the pleasure in this easy, ripe wine is there, the blackberry fruit rich and right up front."
"Big fruited wine, its wood element just a support for the ripe black berry and cranberry flavors. The tannins are a big element here, firm and very dry, but with the fruit freshness, the wine is ready to drink."
"A firm, ripe wine, with good sweet black currant fruit flavors. It is structured, but mainly showing fruit rather than tannins. There is a fine, fresh finish, hinting at wood."
"Smooth, rounded, with an obvious layer of wood to soften the red fruits and dry tannins. This is a balanced wine, offering some good juicy fruits and a bright red berry finish."
"A Merlot-dominated wine from the east bank of the Gironde estuary. It's big, possibly too powerful, with meaty, smoky flavors and spice. Solid, chunky, it gives freshness and liveliness right at the end, as the acidity comes through."
"While there is a mineral austerity to this wine, it has the potential for richness. It offers dark berries and sweet plums under the dense layer of tannins. Give it 2-3 years at least."
"A wood-polished wine, smoothed by mint, black currant and black plum fruits. It has a core of dry, dense tannins, but the fruit and wood around are accessible, giving a wine that has developed fast, and is certainly ready to drink now."
"A Merlot-dominated wine, but with enough tannin from Cabernet Sauvignon to give structure. It is balanced, fresh, moving towards fruitiness, taking in red berries, plums and bright final acidity along the way."
"Huge, rich, flaunting its opulence and ripeness, this super Cuvée from Château Lagarosse, powers with black stewed plums, heavy tannins, layers of wood and spice. The acidity saves it from going over the top, but only just."
"High toast and burnt wood are initially off-putting. The tannins in the wine are also on the smoky side. However, there is fruit here, offering some balance in this powerful, dry wine, and giving some blackberry juiciness, which gives relief from the intensity of the wood."
"Under the ownership of American Stephen Adams, this estate is showing promise. The wine is finely structured, a smoky bacon element mingling well with fresh red plum and firm tannins. The core is dry, solid, showing wood, finishing with vivid minerality and acidity."
"This firm, structured wine conveys a certain austerity. There is fruit but the skeleton of the wine is very present, emphasized by the tannins. The dry core needs to soften to allow the black-currant fruit to come through. Drink from 2021."
"The Dupuy family can survey their vineyards from a 16th-century castle. This wine is firm, with tannins still very much in place. At the same time, the ripe black-currant and berry fruits give the wine ripeness as well as the delicious freshness of the vintage. Drink from late 2016. This vineyard and the family's Beauséjour were certified organic in 1996, early in Bordeaux terms, and are managed by Gérard Dupuy."
"A field blend of the Enclos vineyard has given a superrich wine, densely packed with juicy black plum fruits and sweet tannins. Ripe, full-bodied with a slight alcohol burn."
"From the far eastern edge of Bordeaux, this wine offers delicious, fresh fruits structured by light tannins. Its black currant flavors are right up front, pleasure without complications."
"Grown on the plain below Saint-Émilion, this open, gently fruity wine is young. Its blackberry flavors still show the wood aging, giving spice as well as attractive fruitiness that will soften and integrate. Drink from 2020."
"A branded Saint-Emilion from the local cooperative, one of the best in Bordeaux. The label is designed to please-bright yellow with a smiling face, so different from the average Bordeaux label. And the wine is also designed to be a crowd puller-soft, open Merlot with very ripe tannins and richness rather than dryness."

"Shows a fair amount of toasty, vanilla-scented oak, but its well balanced by cassis and tobacco notes. Medium-to-full-bodied, with a supple mouthfeel and dusty earth and tobacco flavors. Ripe cherry fruit comes through on the finish, suggesting that better things may emerge in another couple of years."
"There is plenty of fine fruit in this wine. It has fresh, lively blackcurrant flavors as well as generous, soft, sweet tannins. It seems rather one-dimensional at this stage, leaving a question-mark over its development."
"The wine, with its juicy red fruits, has fine acidity as well as a core that has a dry tannin and mineral texture. It is structured and firm with the fruit still developing. Drink from 2020."
"Grown on the flat plain beneath the ridge of Saint-Émilion, this wine comes from light sand and gravel soil. That is reflected in the balance of the wine. Its firm tannins are comfortably embedded in the ripe berry fruits and the wine will soon be ready to drink. Just wait until the end of 2017."
"Still full of tannins, this is a tight strongly textured wine. It is dry, just hinting at black fruits and juicy acidity. It is probably already aged and so will remain a firm wine with fruit flavors in the background."
"Hugely dense and dark, the wine is over the top in all respects. From the heavy bottle to the much too concentrated fruit and wood flavors, it is a statement wine. Its saving grace is the quality of the vintage that inevitably has produced a wine that will balance out the tannins as it matures. Drink from 2019."
"Named after the patron saint of wine producers, this wine is properly balanced, structured and dense. It is not a wine for long aging with its soft tannins and juicy black-fruit acidity. Drink from 2017."
"A large (for Saint-Émilion) estate of 93 acres has produced a dark wine that is layered with tight, dry tannins. The fruit is still buried under this tough exterior, although there are strong hints of the juicy black currant future. Drink from 2018."
"Juicy and fruity with acidity and black currant fruits, this wine comes from a vineyard on slopes at the entrance to Saint-Émilion. It's bright and fresh with lively, easy fruits and soft tannins. Drink from 2017."
"One of the many chateaus with vines on the wide valley floor of the Dordogne, this estate has made a lightly extracted wine that has chocolate as well as blackberry stalkiness. There's freshness as well, with fruit acidity that cuts through the mineral texture. Drink from 2018."
"A rounded, mint and wood-flavored wine from the plain of Saint-Émilion between the city and the river Dordogne. It's balanced and fruity, with just the right amount of tannin to sustain the black currant flavors. It is maturing and will certainly be ready to drink in 2015."
"Young vines have gone into this fruity wine. It is full and rich in the mouth, with juicy black currant fruits and smoky tannins. The attractive perfume from Cabernet Franc moves easily into final acidity. Drink from 2017."
"This rich and rounded wine comes from the flat lands of Saint-Émilion, giving it a soft and gentle feel. Acidity and ripe black fruits dominate the light structure. It's a wine for medium-term aging, ripe and ready to drink from 2016."
"A classically firm wine, it gains weight and richness from the juicy black plum fruits. The firm, dry structure underlies the natural ripe fruitiness. It needs to soften out, so don't drink before 2017."
"Very soft and ripe, this is a juicy wine. It has only the lightest structure, its texture a generous mix of rich fruits and fresh acidity. Drink from 2015."
"This is a richly structured and deliciously juicy wine. The tannins are fully integrated into the fruit. The downside of the wine is a touch of greenness, particularly in the acidity."
"The wood, with its heavy toast and licorice flavors, is dominant. That element makes for a wine that has weight but loses its fruit amid the firm extraction."

"The second wine of Château Fonplégade is fresh and bright with good fruits, berry flavors and some richness. It has good poise; ready to drink in 2-3 years."
"A firm but fresh wine, the black currant fruit flavors right to the fore. Tannins are solid, dry, but fit well with the fruit profile. There is final fresh acidity."

"Soft, ripe and rounded, this shows a gentle side of Bordeaux. The tannins are sweet, just hinting at wood, but this is more about blackberries and a finishing sweetness."
"Smoke and tobacco aromas go with dry, dusty tannins, dried fruits, strong spice and Cabernet Franc perfumes. This is all about dried flavors, the black fruits a supporting element, with a generous, full aftertaste over acidity."
"This is young, dominated by some spicy wood and quite densely textured fruit and tannin. Impressive for a branded wine, all vibrant fruit, balanced by a firm, dry structure, and with a rich aftertaste. Age this for at least 1 year."
"A fairly forward wine with a strong nose of cassis, earth, herbs and tobacco. Spicy plum and roasted red berry flavors on the open, fairly supple palate. Has good fruit and a full finish with moderate tannins that dispalys licorice and dark fruit flavors. Good now, better in two years."

"Untypical of Saint-Julien, this wine is solid, chunky, quite foursquare. But it has good punch, richness and depth, along with concentrated black fruits."
"Made using single-variety vats in the early stages, this is a big, ripe and fruity wine with weight and attractive acidity. Its smoky edge and licorice flavors don't mask the black-currant fruit and acidity. Drink from 2021."
"The wine, unusually 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, is ripe and juicy with some smoky tannins in support. It has a finely perfumed character although touches of extraction give it a bitter edge. That should blow by, leaving an attractive fruity wine."

"While this wine has a dry core, berry flavors accompany the dry tannins. From a 45-acre estate, this ripe, juicy wine shows the structure of the vintage and the rich fruits. Drink from 2021."
"This is a wine on the cusp of being mature. The red-berry flavors are dissipating into a secondary aromatic character. The tannins, though, are still there-very firm and showing no sign of budging. Wait and see, or decant before drinking. This is part of a single-parcel (lieu-dit)single-varietal range."
"Pure Merlot, ripe and fruity, this wine has only the lightest of tannic structure. That makes for a soft rounded wine from the area close to Lussac Saint-Émilion. Black plum and berry flavors are laced with acidity and finish with a smooth aftertaste. Drink now."

This Jean-Pierre and Philippe Riviére label benefits from the ripeness of the vintage to bring out red plum and a rich structure. The acidity and tannins perfectly emphasize the generous fruitiness. Drink from 2018.
"Balanced spice and ripe black fruits give this wine a smooth fruity character. Of course, it has tannins but they are there in a supporting role, lending weight to the fruitiness and the nutmeg spiciness. Drink now."
"Good flavor and feel, with some elegance to boot. Aromas of spices and earth, with a mild bell-pepper element. Positive fruit, with plum, blackberry and cocoa on the medium palate. Even some complexity and structure on the medium-length finish."
"This is a bold and ripe wine from the gravel soil of Lalande de Pomerol. It is now reaching maturity. It has rich blackberry fruits, layered with acidity. The tannic core is still firm giving the wine the chance to age further. Drink until 2022."
"The vineyards of this estate take their name from their hillside (Puy) position. The wine is still very young with its generous black fruits and acidity still bubbling with energy. With tannins in the background, it will be a wine that develops relatively quickly, certainly ready to drink by 2019."
"In its antique bottle, this wine (one of a limited series) is laden with more wood than fruit. It will certainly soften, allowing the black fruits to come through, but this amount of wood will be hard to balance out. Drink from 2020."
"Ripe while still firmly tannic, this wine is still very young. It has a tough character from the dry extraction and new-wood aging, leaving a bitter edge that needs to soften. Made from organically grown grapes, the wine will likely be ready to drink from 2022."

"As with other wines produced by the Dulon family, this suffers from too much oak. Here it shows in the wood acidity, the burnt character and the bitter coffee flavors. It's a shame because somewhere under there is fruit. A year or two more will help, so wait until 2018."

"Situated to the north of the village of Listrac, this estate is one of several that carries the name Dupré. The wine is dominated by Merlot (60%).

"This smoky wine offers some attractive ripe fruits and stalky tannins. It is fresh, showing black currant acidity, a rounded wine that will develop quickly. Drink from 2017."

"Wood and smoke aromas precede ripe and dusty tannins lacing this red plum flavored wine. It has a rich texture, as well as being fruity, juicy, finished with taut acidity."

"A wood-dominated wine, all the dryness coming from barrels rather than fruit. Will it broaden out? It's hard to find the fruit at the moment, but there is weight under the wood, so perhaps."

"Ripe and fleshy, this wine is firm and dry, but has extra-ripe fruit. Perhaps the fruit is too rich, leaving the wine unbalanced. In the future, it will show fewer tannins and more fruit. Corinne and Charles-Henri Gonet of the Gonet Champagne family bought Bacalan with the intent of restructuring the vineyards, some of which had not been planted for 70 years. The first red vintage was 2001; first white vintage was 2014."
"This wine is fresh with acidity, rather than fruit. The dry core shows up in wood flavors that still need to integrate with fruit. Give this wine a few years and it will come together while always being on the lean side. Drink from 2018."

"Soft and fresh, this fruity wine comes from sandy soil that gives it lightness, especially in this vintage. Fresh fruits and soft tannins make this wine ready to drink now."

"Fresh, juicy wine, with a smoky wood character, light black currant flavors and soft tannins. It is bright, just a little green, ready to drink."

"One of two reds from the Chombart family's 209-acre estate. This simpler one emphasizes fresh black currant fruit flavors rather than complexity. There is a good balance between fruit, acidity and some smooth tannins. It's a wine for a good piece of grilled chicken."
"There's plenty of classic Bordeaux black currant here, freshening up this fruity, fragrantly fresh wine. The tannins are a whisper under all this great fruit."

"Produced in a vineyard at the base of the hill of Saint-Émilion, this accessible wine is soft, ripe and fruity. It has a generous texture from the vintage and bold black fruits spiced with wood aging. Drink from 2019."
"A small property bought by Jean-Louis Trocard in 1995. This 2004 is dominated, perhaps too much, by new wood. It is difficult to taste the fruit through the wood, and it tastes too light for the amount of wood present. It could come around, but for now, it is for those who like toast and vanilla flavors."
"Already showing some bricking at the rim, this St.-Emilion from the owner of Château Pavie is altogether different from that storied wine. Starts with scents of raisins, smoke and leather, and continues in that vein on the palate, where the flavors run toward dried fruit and vanilla. Supple, soft tannins on the finish suggest early drinkability."
"A surprisingly lean style, with bell pepper aromas and green pepper flavors. There is certainly fruit, and a tannic structure, but the wine seems too lightweight for a 2000 and for this property is a disappointment."
"Dark earth and tobacco spice the aromas of this grand cru, followed by flavors of black cherries and herbs. The Cabernet Franc portion shines clearly through as a distinctive weediness, but it's somewhat balanced by roasted black cherries and only a hint of espresso-like oak."

"This is a structured wine, juicy with black-currant fruit and acidity. It will develop quickly, softening its tannins and filling out with ripe fruit. Drink from 2018."
"Considering the relatively light nature of the vintage, this wine has been overmanipulated. Hard tannins and a bitter chocolate flavor are all too much for the fruit. A gentler approach would have been better."
"This ripe Saint-Émilion is generous with its rounded perfumed Merlot. It gives the wine richness, juicy acidity and an open texture. Touches of tannin do bring in some structure, but the emphasis is on the fruitiness and fresh aftertaste. Drink from late 2017."
"This ripe and fruity wine has an edge of tannins to give it structure. It's full of juicy black fruits, rich berry flavors and fresh acidity. The wine will age as the tannins round out further, so drink from 2018."
"From an estate to the east of the town of Saint-Émilion, this rich wine shows its alcohol in the pepper edge that cuts through the fruit. It tastes firm still and has extracted bitter flavors. The acidity does give the wine a lift and lets the black currant fruit come through. Drink from 2018."
This wine has great fruit with soft tannins and accessible soft black currant fruitiness. A slight earthiness at the end needs to become better integrated. Drink from 2017.

Red-jelly fruit flavors suggest the fruit for this wine was superripe. That gives an unbalanced character between the tannins and the fruit. Acidity at the end is a more hopeful sign.
"While there is plenty of wood around in this Gonfrier family wine, the Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc blend also has good black currant and berry fruits. At the moment it is smoky and toasty, so it needs to soften. Drink from 2017."
"Harvested from a six-acre parcel, this Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon wine is ripe and fruity. It is very developed for a 2012. This means it is soft, smooth, showing mature fruits and finishing with attractive acidity. Definitely to be drunk now."
"Obviously wood aged, this wine's dryness comes from the attenuating character of the barrels. That leaves little room for lean fruit flavors. Maybe it will soften, but the wood is always going to be dominant."
"A fragrant, fruity wine, with fruit tannins, just a hint of wood and tight black-currant fruit. This is a dry wine, firm at the center and needing a year to round out."
"Bright and juicy, this is a fresh, red-fruited wine, ripe and fragrant. The tannic element is almost an afterthought."
"Bitter chocolate aromas and woody flavors are the hallmarks of this smoky, burnt toast-inflected wine. That bitter quality probably won't go away, leaving the fruit behind."
"This wine is dry, structured and heavily extracted. That leaves a bitter note behind the fruit and acidity. It could have benefited from more gentle winemaking, and although it will soften with age, it will always be tough."
"This is an enormous wine, maybe too much. With its layers of rich black fruits and dark tannins, it is a powerful, juicy, jammy and super-ripe wine. It all seems excessive and out of balance. It's fun for a moment, but not for drinking with food."
This is a bold rich wine-perhaps too rich. It has dense black fruits that go with the dark chocolate and licorice flavors. It still has young tannins and acidity and these need to soften. Drink this rich wine from late 2017.
"High spice and toast flavors dominate this wine. The wood use is masking the fruit, probably too enthusiastically. It should soften, although not enough."
"With some attractive tannins and strawberry fruits, this wine has kept its light character. It is developing well into an attractively fruity wine that will be ready from the end of 2016. This is part of a larger estate, Château Haut Rocher, across the line from Castillon in Saint-Émilion. It has been in the family since the 17th century. Jérôme et Béatrice de Monteil took over both properties for the family in 2010."
"This wine is light, juicy and with attractive red fruits brightened with acidity. The tannins suggest a little aging, but there is no need to wait. This Beynat property has been in the family since 1917."
"This fresh and juicy wine is marked by berry fruits and acidity. It's bright and crisp in character, while also having weight and richness. With its soft tannins, it is ready to drink now."
"A softly juicy wine, this is missing structure while it has plenty of fruit. It's ripe, rich and juicy; a pleasure to drink in 2-3 years."
"Minty aromas go along with firm, barely bitter tannins. They dominate the wine, smothering the fruit and lending a burnt quality to the palate."
"A strongly wood-aged wine, very dark and brooding. It has high extract and concentration, with a flash of black pepper on the palate. Tough and finishing hard."
"Dense tannins and a solid, chunky character suggest a wine with richness. The black fruits are concentrated, with juiciness coming through over time. It has the ripe power of the 2009 vintage."
"Made without any wood aging, this wine is all about bright cherry fruit. It shows some stalkiness from the fruit along with plenty of juicy acidity, soft tannins and an easy, open character. Drink now."
"This wine is structured although it does have plenty of ripe and full of berry fruits. Drink from 2017. The blend includes 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc."
"This wine is bright and fruity, with acidity and some fresh red berry fruits. The background tannins do have a dryness but will soften over the next few months. Drink from 2017. This property, east of Saint-Émilion, is run by Florent Dubard."
"There is high acidity on this black currant-flavored wine. It is light and fruity, with a cool feel and taut texture."
"This wine is dry and smoky, with serious tannins. It is concentrated, with bitter chocolate flavors from the wood aging."
"This firm, structured wine is lean and austere. Spice and toast notes dominate, leaving little room for fruit. It's a tough wine to like."
"This is a dry wine, closed and very firm. Its tannins come from the ripe Merlot fruits that were extracted too much. It should soften to bring out the blackberry flavors, but it is likely to remain austere."
"Fresh and fruity, it has ripe blackberries, soft tannins and a fresh aftertaste. It presents an attractive smoky character along with vanilla and a rich aftertaste."
"This light wine offers attractive black currant fruitiness. Burnt tannins from the wood aging give it a bitter edge, although the aftertaste does bring back the freshness of the vintage."
This fruity wine is full of juicy red berries that are laced with acidity. Hints of wood aging stay in the background of this essentially fresh and bright wine.
"For the vintage, this is a surprisingly lean wine. Some juicy fruit is still struggling out of the very dry tannic shell. Acidity is a dominant character of this firm, dry wine."
"Firm and dry, dark and dense, this wine has intense concentration and hard tannins. It feels heavily extracted, giving a bitter, burnt edge. The aftertaste just hints at potential juiciness."
"The spicy wood aroma that shows strongly on the nose of this wine is confirmed on the palate, as it seems to have spent too much time in barrels. The fruit has been neglected and is dry. It will open up with time, although the dryness will probably remain."
"With much of the freshness of 2006 now evolved into more mature flavors, this balanced if somewhat stalky wine has fine perfumed black currant fruit flavors, with a firm core of tannins and wood aging."
"This tightly stalky wine offers fresh red fruits and aromatic acidity. With tannins right up front, it is still young and needing to develop. The wine's name comes from the shirt numbers of the two French rugby players who feature on the label. Drink from 2016."
"An unusual find of an old vintage currently available, this is certainly a mature wine. In fact, it is beginning to dry out-focused on old tannins rather than on the wonderful secondary flavors of a well-aged Bordeaux. For lovers of older wines, this is a bargain curiosity."
"A fresh style of wine, this is all about acidity and crisp red-currant fruits. It has a light feel, bright and fresh at the end. Drink from 2020."
This is a light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. It has spice and a layer of dry tannins that are acting as a support to the red fruits and acidity.
"With 12 months in wood, this is a firm wine, with a rustic, funky character that masks the black-currant fruit. The smoky wood contrasts with the acidity while leaving a dry aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
"This light wine has red berry flavors and lots of acidity. With only the lightest texture, it's all about fruitiness. Drink now."
"While it is light for the structured 2010s, this wine has attractive red fruit flavors and soft tannins. With its gentle structure and good fruity acidity, it's ready soon. Drink from 2015."
"A delicate wine that is completely ready to drink and needs to be consumed now before it ages further. The fruit has developed a secondary, animal character, the tannins starting to dominate with their dryness."
"The wine seems lean, austere and minerally in character. It has stalky black-currant fruits, firm tannins and forward acids. It should age over 2-3 years, but it will always be on the severe side."
"Relatively lightweight, showing freshness rather than density, this is a fruity, red currant- and red plum-flavored wine that is lifted by a good use of wood aging, spice, and enclosed by vibrant acidity."
"From a large 177-acre estate in the southern Graves, this wine shows plenty of stalky, black currant fruits, fresh acidity and spice from wood. It has just the right characters for a food Bordeaux, dry core of tannins and vivid fruit around."
"For a 2003, this seems rather lean. The red fruits are turning mature now, and leaving some astringency behind. The wine is becoming herbal, with green pepper acidity. It's pleasant to drink, but is unlikely to develop."
"Fruit from old vines go into this freshly fruity, black currant-flavored wine. There is some wood, but the tannins in this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine come mainly from the fruit, leaving a wine which is light but with a dry core."
"This is a ripe, well-integrated wine that shows the charming, elegant side of Graves wine. Without great depth of flavor, it has attractive black berry fruits and soft tannins."
"One of the group of estates owned by Jean-Michel Lapalu (the others include Liversan), this is a relatively soft wine, but one with good ripe fruits. This means that it is ready to drink now, an easy wine, with pleasant stalky tannins. Imported by Wine Frog."
"Under the same ownership as Château de Malleret in the southern Médoc, this neighboring estate is firm and tannic with a dry hard core. That dryness and structure will probably remain even as the fruit fills out to give blackberry flavors. Less extraction would have helped."
The 65% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend has produced a wine that is tight with as much acidity as fruit. It does have a juicy edge that is attractive although overall the wine seems thin and dry.
"High-toast aromas are followed on the palate by flavors that are more about wood than fruit. That gives the wine a tough, extracted character that probably will not go away."
"One of the estates in the Lapalu family stable, Liversan is to the west of Pauillac. In 2013 it has produced a light, fruity wine with attractive acidity and some dry tannins. Unfocused at this stage, it hopefully will develop a richer character as it matures. Drink from 2017."
"Situated outside Listrac, this estate has produced a soft, unfocused wine. It has tannins and gentle fruitiness and acidity. Drink from 2017."
"Fresh and fruity, this wine is full of black currants and acidity that is structured by a core of dark tannins. While it is firm at the moment it's likely to fill out, with the fresh fruitiness emerging. Drink from 2017."
"Fresh and fruity, this wine is already developing attractively. The wood aging gives some toasty character although the black currant fruitiness makes the wine accessible and bright. Drink from late 2015."
This fruity wine is already easy to drink. It is soft with a layer of wood-aging flavors that don't take much away from the open fruitiness. Drink from the end of 2015.
"This is a simple, fruity wine without great tannic structure. It has attractive berry fruits and a dry core. With its fresh acidity, it will be ready to drink soon."
"Attractive and balanced, this has light tannins and fresh black currant fruitiness. Everything is in the right place, correct if not more. The aftertaste has a good, food-friendly acidity."
"A juicy, fruity, soft wine, it has a gentle tannic character. Red berry flavors, soft acidity and fresh texture combine to give a light wine that will be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2015."
"Light and fruity, this is a fresh, rounded wine with attractive berry fruits. It is already smooth, although the tannins are in the background. It's fragrant with a medium-term potential. Drink from 2015."
"Jammy with soft fruits and ripe tannins, this is an attractive, forward wine that doesn't need much time to age. So enjoy the red fruits and acidity from 2016."
"There seems to be too much wood here which is smothering the fruit. Given that, the wine does have weight and as the wood softens, the juicy fruit flavors should come through. Wait to drink until 2016. But it will always be austere."
"This richly fruity wine is attractively balanced, showing ample acidity, black currant fruit and a general forward fruitiness. It's not a wine of great depth. Ready to drink now."
"The headquarters of Bordeaux négociant Barton & Guestier has produced a soft, ready-to-drink wine. It's attractive, ripe and rich, and it's full of juicy blackberry fruit. Drink now."
"With red berry fruitiness, this is an attractive wine. It has a light texture, some juicy acidity and it's ready to drink."
"Structured and fruity, this has black currant flavors, dry tannins and a definite wood-aged feel. It is elegant, not powerful, opening slowly to reveal its fine fruit and acidity."
"On the austere side, the tannins dry and firm. The fruit flavors echo the severe character, with red currant flavors and a slight vegetal edge."
"The wine has some weight, dominated by dry tannins and a dark edge of black currants. For a 2005, it is surprisingly light, but the elements of ripe fruit and balancing acidity are there, even if the tannins and wood still dominate."
"Toasty and woody, this wine is currently dominated by the wood aging, leaving little space for the juicy red fruits in the background. It will soften and should be less aggressive from 2019."
"The full whammy of bacon and sweet smokiness on the nose announces that this wine was heavily oaked. And the tannins and lemony nuances that penetrate the palate and finish confirm that. In between there's ripe, blasting cherry fruit and acids that create a sweet-tart candy impression."
"The wine is lean with austere tannins and plenty of structure. What is seems to be missing is the fruit potential. It will soften over time, although probably not enough."
"Firmly tannic, this wine is solid, firm and traditional in its dry structure. Black currant fruitiness shows briefly before the tannins and dark extract take over. It's a tough wine at this stage and could well remain hard. Try drinking from 2017."
"Mature already, displaying leather, earth and tobacco nuances on the nose, followed by flavors of black cherry and tobacco. Light-bodied, with a juicy, mouthwatering finish. Drink over the next 2-3 years."
"Animal and bell pepper aromas mask a soft, relatively lightweight wine, which has fine acidity and fresh red fruit flavors."
"A wine that offers plenty of the charm of Margaux, with its soft tannins, layers of chocolate, smooth texture and juicy fruit. The wood at this stage is prominent, and needs to settle down."
"This is a disappointment. The wine is tart, stalky and, at the same time, light. It has an edge of green that suggests underripe fruit. Developing fast."
"Tight and tannic, this is a wine with as much structure as fruit. It has a dusty, austere quality, the fruit a light layer underneath. The high proportion of Petit Verdot in the blend gives color as well as those tannins."
"This wine brings out the soft side of Margaux with its easy and friendly fruits. Although there are definite tannins, they are well below the surface of the red berries and fresh acidity. Ready to drink now."
"A blend of equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this fresh, open wine is made to drink young. The red-fruit flavors, soft tannins and layer of ripe acidity are balanced and integrated. The wine is ready now."
"A soft wine that has easy but attractively ripe fruit. This is not a wine for aging, but in 2003, the estate has made a very drinkable wine. Patache stands for an ancient coaching inn, recollected on the wine's label by a coach and horses. Imported by Grands Chais de France."
"A usually reliable performer, Patache d'Aux produced a solid wine in the difficult 2002 vintage. A whiff of mint carries through on the palate, which blends herbs, berries and vanilla in a straightforward claret. Fruit shows through the firm tannins on the finish, suggesting this will improve over the next few years. Drink 2008-2012."
"Owned by the Francisco family since 1870, this wine is juicy and just lightly stalky, with fine crisp acidity. Needing to develop and soften its firm texture, it will be ready to drink from 2020."
"This fresh, stalky wine has hints of wood. The fruit is light and only just ripe, giving it a tight character, with plenty of acidity and a dry core of tannins. It will be ready to drink in a crisp way from 2017."
"This stalky, firmly tannic wine is still developing. Dominated by Merlot, it has black currant fruits in the background with acidity and crispness. Give this structured wine another few years and drink from 2016."
"Heavy wood aromas are mitigated on the palate by the ripe fruit, making for a rich wine with black plum flavors as well as a core of tannins. It's going to develop well and quickly, so drink from 2016."
"Strong wood aromas mark this wine that's shot through with wood-aging flavors. Spice and smoky toast are evident, but the ripe blackberry flavors are big enough to balance this Merlot-dominated wine. Drink from 2017."
"Marked by red berry fruits and soft tannins, this has a juicy character, with touches of wood aging that are already integrated. The aftertaste, with its fresh currant acidity and rounded fruit, shows that this will be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2016."
"This is a smooth, velvet-textured wine. Its tannins are totally integrated into the ripe berry flavors. With its soft texture and open structure, it is almost ready to drink now. Wait until late 2015."
This stalky wine shows wood aging as much as fruit. Toast and some bitter extraction are contrasted with tight black currant fruits. It will soften and turn into an approachable fruity wine.
"This wine is layered with wood that has softened the young fruitiness, adding spice and toast. The wine just keeps the right, juicy side of being too woody. It should be drunk now-2015."
"With black currant fruits dominant, this is an inherently fruity wine. The juicy feel makes the wine seem light, not yet quite connecting between fruit and a very dry tannic texture. Give it until 2016."
"Bold and juicy, this is a ripe, forward wine. With red berry fruits prominent, it conveys attractive fruitiness. Tannins in the background suggest medium-term aging. Drink from 2016."
"A full and ripe wine, it is richly layered with black fruits, soft tannins and a juicy, warm aftertaste. The acidity at the end adds a little freshness. It's made to be drunk now."
"With considerable spicy, smoky wood, this is a rich, while extracted, wine. It does have some juicy fruit that shows potential so it should soften and become less bitter. Drink from 2017."
"Smoky wood aromas are confirmed on the palate by a tough, wood-laden character. It's all spice and toast, leaving little room at this stage for fruit. That should come because the wine has weight and suggestions of rich berry fruits in the background."
"This is a stalky, black currant and spice flavored wine. It has relatively soft tannins while showing a meaty, juicy character. The wine is for medium-term aging, so drink from 2016."
"With layers of new wood and spice flavors, this wine is highly structured without much fruit to balance. It will develop into a dry, firm wine, showing light black fruit flavors surrounded by textured tannins."
"Firm, dark and finely tannic, this has weight and richness, with a severity that dominates the fruitiness. It's dry and tough, and it's aging potential is questionable."
"This is a smoky, wood-aged wine, with a bitter toast flavor that smothers the fruit. It does have the fruit weight, so that toast flavor will certainly soften. But to judge by the intense wood character, this bottling will likely always have a severe edge."
"The wood influence in this wine is almost too much for the fruit, even in the future. It has a severe, burnt character that shows an herb flavor and a tight texture."
"On the lean side, this is a tannic and structured wine. The fruit is stalky, with a black currant note and tight acidity, creating a wine that needs 1-2 years to really soften."
"Soft and ripe, this is an easy, fruity wine. It has red berries, gentle tannins and attractive acidity. It is just as enjoyable as an apéritif as with food and ready to drink now."
Spicy wood thrusts this wine forward. It does have enough weight of blackberry fruit to compensate.
"A soft wine, with some light wood aging while the fruit gives black currant stalkiness, dry tannins and fresh, juicy, smoky acidity. The wine needs no aging, but could develop for 2-3 years."
"On the austere side, this shows more tannin than fruit, based around a dry core that has spread through the wine. There is some black plum skin and black currant fruit, but it is hard to find."
"Tight wine, its black currant flavors layered with dry tannins. It's finely structured, although the stalky element tends to dominate. Not for aging."
"Confusingly, the wine has no connection with Château Magnol, also owned by Barton & Guestier. It's a soft Médoc wine, light and gentle in character, the tannins soft, merging with the red berry fruits."
"Smooth, open, fruity wine, with good black berry flavors, rounded by wood. The tannins offer a bite to go with the acidity. Age for a year."
"The second wine of Médoc Château La Cardonne is a light, fruity wine with red berry fruits, acidity and a fresh tannin character. It is pleasingly ready to drink now."
"A wine that is perfumed with new wood. The fruit has the freshness of 2007, high acids, cranberry juice, not weighty. Needs to age for another year."
"Balanced but very firm, with dominant tannins, here is a wine with an angular feel to it. The tannins give a meaty character as well as laying alongside the plum skin flavors. It is dry, with some definite acidity."
"Soft and fruity, this is a light wine with gentle tannins and acidity. Black-currant fruits go with the crisp texture to make a wine that will be ready to drink from 2019."
"At this stage, the wood-aging component of this wine dominates the gentle black fruits. An element of high toast and black-chocolate extraction flavors give bitterness. It seems this wine will always have a hard edge."
"A light, rather diffuse wine, with the fruit soft and ripe. The flavor of red plum juice and tomato give some sweetness, the tannins only a minor element in this ready-to-drink wine."
"This is big and dense. There seems to be too much structure and not enough fruit for the weight of the tannins. That said, there is also a good smoky character that gives spice and lifts the final black currant fruit flavor."
"A dense wine, with black fruits that go in one direction, and tannins that go in another. Maybe this is because it's young. There is some good, ripe acidity and blackberry flavors, so in six months, this may well integrate."
This is a spicy wine with some attractive red fruits. There is a rustic barnyard character that is less pleasing. The juicy acidity at the end does give a lift to what is a disappointing wine.
"The wine has red fruits and spice from wood aging. It suffers from the lean character of the vintage, giving a wine that shows tannins while not having enough fruitiness. Drink from 2017."
"Dominated by 80% Merlot with licorice and dark chocolate, the wine has strong flavors of new wood that give a vanilla and caramel character. It is solid, with a strong tannic presence. Put all this together and this is a wine that is likely always to be firm."
"This is a soft wine, with attractive red-currant fruit and open, smoky tannins. It's well balanced between the fruit, tannins and acidity, which lends a crisp aftertaste."
"This wine is soft, juicy and light. It has only the slightest texture, leaving its flavors entirely with blackberry fruitiness. That makes it an attractive, open wine with a fresh aftertaste. Drink now."
"This wine is packed with tannins, less packed with fruit. That gives it a tough character, very dry and not fruity enough. The estate is owned by the Perrin family of Château Carbonnieux."
"Wood aromas are repeated on the palate with a dry bitterness. This wine should soften as it develops, although that over-enthusiastic use of wood could remain. This is one of several Bordeaux estates owned by André Lurton."
"This is a curiously juicy wine that is not fully integrated with the dry tannins. It has a hard-edged texture, a dry character that sits uneasily with the crisp black currant fruitiness."
"This is a dense, dry wine, full of concentrated tannins and somewhat hard-edged. While it does have acidity, it misses out on the fruitiness and ends up being tough and tannic."
"This wine is lean, more about structure than tannins. Some juicy fruitiness is overwhelmed by the dry core of the wine that seems over-extracted."
"With tight acidity and intense black currant fruits, this wine has a raw edge. It presents a full, fresh, crisp texture that's bright, with layers of acidity at the end."
A very youthful wine that needs time. It has coffee bean aromas and accents of wood and black currants. Needs time for the acidity to develop and soften. Give it 4-5 years. Imported by William Grant & Sons.
"Still fresh, this shows red currant and red berry fruit flavors over a smoky layer of wood, licorice and spice. It has some warmth, a smoothly textured wine that only has a glimpse of rustic tannin beneath the flavors."
This wine offers plenty of black-currant fruits with a structured edge. The bitter aftertaste needs to soften before the wine is ready to drink.

This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.
"Dominated by its 86% Merlot, this is a fruity wine that is surprisingly light for the vintage. It comes from the plain between Saint-Émilion and the Dordogne River, giving a soft style with just a touch of tannin. Drink from 2017."
"This 90-acre vineyard has produced an attractive, light wine. Fruity with red-berry flavors, it is already soft and fresh. Acidity and touches of tannin are balanced enough for the wine to be ready to drink."
A light and rather stalky wine from the flat plain close to the Dordogne river. It has some black currant flavors that are firmed out by dry tannins. The aftertaste is fresh and juicy.
"Tannins and structure bring out the character of the 2010 vintage in this open, generally soft wine. It is already attractive, drinkable and fresh. Black currants dominate the natural fruitiness. Drink now."
"This very ripe wine is structured with considerable new-wood flavors. It's hard, tannic and extracted, missing a sense of fruitiness."
"Stalky in character, this has black currant fruits on a lean structure. The wood is not yet fully integrated and the wine could well flesh out in a couple of years."
Heavy bottles and heavy extract seem to go together; proving the point is this wine. Heavy toast dominates the berry fruit. The normal wine from Cheval Noir is much more attractive.
"A top Cuvée from Château Cheval Noir, with wood dominating the plum juice fruits. It is tough, the tannins giving considerable dryness, while the fruit behind seems lightweight."
"Very fresh, with well-judged wood and very juicy fruit, a wine that is almost shocking in its youthful acidity. It bursts in the mouth, fruit and bright."
"Barrel aged for 12 months, this 95% Merlot wine (with a dash of Cabernet Franc) is very dominated by its wood. That gives it a seriously toasty character that dominates the fruit. At five years old, it should be more balanced."
"It is fascinating how some wines from this vintage have gone from youth to old age without passing maturity. That's the case here: this wine is showing age, with tannins that have become dry, leaving the secondary flavors, let alone the fruit, behind."
"There's good density here. This wine shows plenty of ripe Merlot fruit flavors, jammy, lifted with dried fruits and blackberries. It's a rounded, ripe wine, but shot through with a curious, unbalanced, very dry wood element."
"Ripe, sweet and easy, with dried fruit flavors, some ripe fruit and light tannins. Perfumed and attractive; there's just a touch of bitterness from the wood."
"A much less dense wine than either '95 or '96, reflecting the vintage. Red berry fruit aromas with dusty tobacco notes. Lighter, juicy mouthfeel with chocolate and leather notes. Mildly drying finish. Well-made but light, with a definite herbaceous quality."
"This is a dark and probably too-tannic wine. A very dry, extracted character gives bitterness more than fruit. It's still young and has the Saint-Estéphe tannins in abundance, although its future with this dryness is uncertain."
"A core of dry tannins and an austere edge give a wine that is hard to like. There is some attractive berry fruit, but it is caught up in the hard character."
"Highly juicy wine, packed with tannins as well as black currants and red berries. Green pepper, spice and high acidity are strongly present."
"A second label of the famous second growth, Chateau Gruaud Larose, this wine offers charming scents of cherries, cedar and herb, but clamps down on the palate with dusty, slightly drying tannins that don't appear to have the depth of fruit to support them for long-term aging. Drink over the next few years with rare beef or lamb to help rein in the tannins."
"The wine's stalky character, acidity and black-currants are lit by light tannins. It is likely to age quickly, and be ready to drink from 2018."
"The branded wine from Domaines Lapalu (owner of Château Patache d'Aux) is a soft, clean, black currant-flavored Cabernet. The tannins show a mineral, tight edge, but the wine is on the light side."
"A fresh, fruity branded Bordeaux from the producers of Château Patache d'Aux. It has friendly, approachable fruit, with light wood, good ripe plums and berries and a firm, but juicy finish."
"This young wine is full of black currant fruit and balanced tannins. It has the richness of high alcohol, which brings out a touch of pepper. But juicy fruit dominates. Drink from 2018."
"Soft and bright with red berry fruit, this is a warm, open and easy wine. It has a gentle texture and just enough tannins to give it shape. Drink now."
Juicy fruits and soft tannins give a light wine that is developing quickly. Drink from 2020.
"The wine shows the richness of the vintage while also showing some firm extracted tannins. At this stage, the wine is too dry and firm. Give it until 2018 for a little softening."
"Despite its heavy bottle, this is not a wine for aging. It's been made deliberately soft and fruity without any wood aging. Red berry fruits have a light acidity and only hints of a structure. Drink now and until 2018."
"This solidly tannic wine is largely balanced by ample fruit. Perfumed and smoky, but with its dry wood and firm, extracted tannins, it is likely always to be a dry wine."
"Firmly structured, this has a dry core that's solidly based on smoky tannins. The fruit is holding back, although in a few months the blackberry flavor should surface. The finish retains the dry, firm character of the wine."
"Solid, chunky and dense, this shows a rich character based around dark tannins. It has a ripe black-plum flavor and juicy acidity on the finish."
"This estate, in the center of the Entre-deux-Mers region, has produced a successful wine in this warm vintage. The 100% Merlot delivers great fruit while allowing a place for dry tannins. The wine has a lightness to it and is ready to drink."
"This wine's smooth texture is soft, velvety, needing tannins to give it a sense of shape. As it tastes in the mouth now, it shows pleasant sweet berry flavors and a dense mouthfeel. In the end, it is an easy-drinking, early maturing wine."
"Called authentic because there is no added sulphur, this wine is all fruit, without any wood aging. On the palate, it is juicy, packed with acidity and red-fruit flavors. The aftertaste brings out a metallic, tight edge to the wine."
"A ripe, very smooth second wine of Château Siaurac, rich while still full of fresh fruit that already shows elegance and a light touch. The wine is likely to age well and soon, so drink from 2015."
"Bordeaux wine should not have high alcohol; it detracts from the play between fruit and tannins, as in this wine. It is powered by its extracted structure, with flavors of bitter chocolate that leave the fruit behind."
"Light, fresh, fruity wine, with a smoky complexity. The acidity and red currants are more intense than the dry structure. The whole wine is tight, stalky, finishing with toughness."
"Tight red currants and soft tannins give a wine that is bright and packed with fruitiness. The blend of 80% Merlot with Cabernet Sauvignon is lightly oaked, but mainly fruity. Drink from 2019."
"Firm, tannic and dry, this wine has some flashes of fresh black currant flavors, and a lift of acidity. It needs time to aerate before drinking, when it will have some freshness and lightness."
"Fruity and lightly spicy from wood aging, this wine has black fruit aromas. It's lightly tannic, with just enough structure to make it an early-drinking wine. Drink now."
"This ripe, rich wine has solid tannins and still-young blackberry fruit. Although a basic Bordeaux, it is extra rich and extracted and, surprisingly, needs to age. Drink from 2019."

"This wine comes from a southfacing hillside vineyard not far from Pomerol. An unusual blend for Bordeaux, with 80% Merlot and 20% Malbec, it is fresh and perfumed, with firm tannins and black-currant flavors. Although it comes from the poorly rated 1999 vintage, it has good, ripe fruit. Like so many Bordeaux, this is a food wine, great with steaks."
"Dark in color, with a bit of lemony oak to the nose as well as chocolate and black plum. The palate is a basic Bordeaux mix of cassis, earth, plum and tree bark. The clean, smooth finish confirms the wine's ripeness. A good middle-of-the-road red for everyday affairs."
"This wine is tight with tannins and a dry core. By contrast, the rest seems light and thin."
"Jammy strawberry flavors mark this ripe wine. The fruit is perhaps too mature, giving an unbalanced aftertaste."
"The fruit seems too ripe in this wine, giving a jammy character surrounding a dry core. It could balance better in a few years."
Jammy ripe fruit has become entangled with extracted tannins in this clumsy wine. Red-berry flavors are there but lack balancing acidity.
"From a 17-acre Merlot-dominated vineyard, this is a dry wine, where the tannins dominate the fruit. The wine has a bitter edge from too much extraction. The hints of fruit are not quite enough."
This Merlot/Cabernet Franc blend is a tight closed wine showing tannins rather than fruit. It will remain this way.
This Alliance Bourg wine is dry and firm with its concentrated tannins. Too much extraction has left a bitter character. It will remain a wine that is tough.
"Shooting for wine that will age for at least 15 years, this has too much wood for its own good. Dark and spicy with tough toast, it will likely remain that way. Somebody tried too hard."
"This is a lean wine, all tannins and missing fruit. It is dry and showing considerable hard extraction. It will soften, but not much."
"This wine is all crisp red currants and acidity. Fresh, fruity and lightly textured, it is a wine to drink young, from 2016."
"Firm but with juicy fruit, this 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is a solid, still young, wine. The aftertaste is tough and packed with acidity."
"This wine is concentrated, with fruit that seems too ripe. Jammy berry flavors are mixed in with dry tannins and a firm backdrop. It's solid, although not quite balanced. The estate was founded in 1967 by Philippe Raguenot; daughters Emmanuelle and Marie-Pierre took over in 1997."
"Heavy wood aromas from new French oak barrels show equally strongly as dark chocolate flavors on the palate from this 50/50 Merlot/Malbec blend. The wine, tiny production from 2.5 acres, is all wood, very firm and tough. Only the acidity suggests a potential fruitiness. This estate has been in the Noël family since 1800."
Jammy fruits conflict with a firm tannic structure. This wine is not yet balanced and needs a lighter touch. Producer is Jean Paul Barre.
"This wine is soft and juicy with 12 months in barrel. It has rounded tannins and perfumed berry fruits. What it misses is the acidity, leaving an unbalanced wine."
"The wine is perfumed, spicy with dense tannins. It has a hard-edged structure, tough with the ripe fruit still underneath. Vines are an average of 14 years old."
"This dry wine is strongly dominated by tannins. It is structured, firm and hard-edged. Without the fresh acidity at the end, it would be a tough proposition."
"The wine has some of the typical freshness of 2011 but it seems on the thin side. Black currant flavors run alongside high acidity, and the tannins show strongly. The aftertaste brings out more tight, mineral acidity."
"A firm, licorice-flavored wine, with bitter notes and a peppery character that shows through the fruit. It feels extracted and hot."
"High acidity cuts through this wine from the get-go. The tannins also show a hard edge. This is a wine for the future, always with a sense of austerity and minerality."
"Almost too fruity, the wine has red berry fruits in profusion. What is missing is the tannin to hold it together, making this a fruity wine to drink soon."
"This wine is lean, with a light texture that brings out juicy black fruit and intense acidity. It misses out on the concentration and richness of the vintage."
"This wine's green, herbal character suggests underripe fruit. All bell pepper and spice flavors, the fruit seems left behind."
"New wood aromas lead this toasty wine that has spice, high toast flavors and the smallest hint of fruit. If the producer had not been so enthusiastic with the oak, this could have been a good wine."
"Heavily wood aged, this wine is tough and dry, with aggressive toast flavors. The concentration is there but is not from fruit."
"Dry, firm and tough, this wine lacks the fruit fruit to come through the structure. It's a wine for those who like plenty of wood."
"Minty new wood aromas are the theme in this wood-laden wine. It has a burnt character from high extraction and wood aging, making it hard to discern the fruit, although there is a juicy character at the end."
"Spicy and smoky, this wine is dark with tannins and dryness. Its dark chocolate and bitter coffee flavors suggest tough extraction. The fruit does not stand a chance."
"Light and fruity, this gently structured wine offers spice and wood flavors. Drink from 2020."
"One of the brands produced by this large cooperative, this rich wine has an odd earthy character that is less appealing. It is ready to drink."
"Red berry fruits dominate this young wine. While it has a firm structure, the attractiveness of the fruit and acidity give it the potential to age quickly. Drink this wine from 2020."
"This wine is soft, fruity and likely to be ready to drink soon. Its red fruits and acidity are already attractive. Drink from 2020."
"This soft, jammy wine does not have much structure. It will develop quickly, giving red-berry flavors and acidity."
"This is a tight, acid and black-currant-fruited wine. Still young, it has firm tannins and a bitter edge that needs to blow away. Drink from 2019."
"Malesan is the bestselling Bordeaux brand in France, and this wood-aged version shows the French have got it right. With the quality of the 2000 vintage to help it along, it is ripe, packed with black currant flavors and ripe acidity plus just a touch of wood. Anybody in Bordeaux should visit the Malesan cellar, which is like a football ground, with the tasting room set out on a stage in the central pitch, surrounded by tiers of barrels instead of spectators."
"Quite herbal, with some green beans and anise up front. Black fruit takes a back seat but is there if you look for it. Blackberry and beach plums come to mind. The tannins are a bit rustic. Kosher"
"Currently this wine is much too dominated by wood. There is some dark, tarry fruit, but the wood is ever-present. Buy this wine if you like wood flavors, the question is whether the fruit is powerful enough to come through."
"Smells plummy and ripe but tastes of bright cherries and shows a lean, claret-style mouthfeel. It's a little thin, but still manages to provide pleasure. Finishes with tasty mocha and toast shadings.  White Wine"
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Malbec produced only in good vintages, this year's Verdillac is light but charming. It begins with earthy, blackberry and smoke aromas, and while the tannins are pretty fierce, there's some underlying good fruit. The finish is bitter and requires rich foods."
"There are soft grapefruit-peach aromas and flavors, tart lime notes and a medium body here. It's not complex, but it's not supposed to be. It has no bad marks at all, and even a little length to show. A good bar pour or gallery opener."
"Straightforward, perhaps even simple, but once again well-made inexpensive juice. At 80% Merlot, it is soft with berry and hint of tobacco predominating. The light fruit has pleasant cocoa shadings, and it has a poised finish with mild tannins."
"Dry and structured, the wine has a way to go before the fruit shows. It is over-extracted giving a hard bitter edge. Give the fruit a chance and wait until mid 2018."
"Firmly structured, the wine is dry and with dark tannins. Its fruit is currently masked. Give it until late 2017."
"The wine is rich and packed with superripe blackberry fruits. While there is acidity to keep the wine crisp, it does have a heavy feel to it from the high alcohol that also brings a pepper edge. Drink from 2018."
"Firm with tannins, this is a dry wine. Its tough structure dominates the berry fruit, needing time to balance out. Drink from 2018."
The tannins and high toast flavors have taken over this wine. The fruit has been submerged. It is difficult to see this completely balancing out.
"This is a ripe wine, mainly from Merlot, showing fruit that is jammy and almost sweet. With attractive acidity to balance, it is soft, smooth and ready to drink."
"From vines in the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers, the wine is fresh, fruity and light. It has red-currant flavors that are bright and crisp. It's perfumed by the Cabernet Franc that dominates the blend. Drink from 2018."
"The wine is dry, firm and with too many tannins for its own good. It does have hints of fruit along with spice and acidity. Shame about the over extraction that gives it a bitter aftertaste."
"Initially a little rustic, the wine does open out. It is smoky, fruity with the acidity of the vintage."
"This is a structured, firm wine that has tense tannins and acidity. It is smoky with a dry core. The fruit is just not there."
The wine is spicy and laden with wood. It has an extracted character that produces chocolate and bitter coffee flavors. The fruit is hard to find at this stage.
This red-currant and red-berry flavored wine is bright and fruity. It does have some wood-aging flavors that add spice and a dry edge. The juicy acidity at the end keeps it all fresh.
"An homage to the classic French mustache (rarely see now), this is an amusing label interpretation of simple, fruity Bordeaux. It has plenty of black-currant fruits and a lightly stalky texture that balances the crisp acidity. Drink now."
"Light in color, the wine is equally light in flavor-a soft, gentle wine with only hints of tannins. Fruity without much depth, it is ready to drink, ."
"This soft, ready-to-drink wine is all about black-currant fruitiness, with only the lightest of tannins. Juicy, fresh acidity finishes an attractive wine."
"This soft, jammy and fruity wine is ready to drink, with black-currant flavors that are ripe and rounded. Only the lightest tannins gives any structure to this wine that is immediately accessible."
"Produced from organically grown grapes, this soft wine has red fruits that miss much definition, only hinting at some stalky acidity. It is ready to drink."
"From the east of the Bordeaux region, this light and juicy wine has attractive, forward acidity and the gentlest of tannins. Fresh and fruity, it is ready to drink."
"This wine has attractive fruit, crisp acidity and a good balance with the light tannic structure. Bright and fresh wine, it is ready to drink. This is one of the Ducourt family properties on the Right Bank of Bordeaux."
"Crisp raspberry flavors give this Barthe family wine an attractive fruitiness and acidity. It is light on the palate, still tight and needs a few more months. Drink from 2016."
"This wine is fruity, with only a light texture of acidity and stalky black currant fruit flavors. From the difficult 2013 vintage, it is lit with acidity and fresh fruit at the end. Drink now. The d'Arfeuille family is in its fifth century on Bordeaux's Right Bank."
"This wine is full of acidity as much as red fruits. Crisp, tight and with freshness from the red currant fruits, it is ready to drink. This is one of the Vignobles Jean Queyrens et Fils wineries."
"While this wine has a strong tannic structure, it also offers plenty of ripe fruit. Acidity is kept in its place, giving freshness allied to warm berries. Drink this attractive wine from 2016."
"Forward red fruits give a good beginning to this light and fruity blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is crisp with red currant flavors and layers of acidity. Drink now."
"Light, ripe and fruity, this wine is bursting with black currant fruits supported by a firm base of dry fruit tannins. It can be drunk now in its youth, but will be better from 2016."
"Still dominated by wood and toast aromas, this wine is certainly too young to drink. The wood needs to smooth out and allow room for the fruit. It will age, with its fresh fruits and acidity, so drink from 2017."
"Pure fruitiness, this wine is full of black currant flavors and a stalky, dusty texture. Without wood aging, it has acidity, fruitiness and some dry tannins. Drink from the end of 2015."
"The 56 acres of this estate are in the heart of the Entre deux Mers region. This young and fruity wine has stalky black currant fruits and fresh acidity. There's a light touch of spicy wood and a crisp, red fruit aftertaste."
"This is a light, obviously wood-aged wine. Black currant fruitiness is right up front along with a spicy, toasty character. That wood will integrate shortly with the acidity to give a fruity, friendly wine."
"Light and fruity, this red berry, stalky flavored wine is crisp with acidity and soft tannins. It's developing fast and will be ready to drink from 2015."
"Fresh, light and juicy, this wine is ready to drink. Lively and crisp, it has such soft tannins and fresh acidity. There is little in the way of structure or potential, so drink now."
"The wine is all about juicy fruit, only lightly hinting at a structure. It's immediately attractive wine and ready to drink now."
"Stalky black currant fruits dominate this wine. It has acidity, juicy fruitiness and a dry, tight aftertaste. It's not for long aging."
"Full of red berry fruits, this has some attractive fresh acidity to add to the light, bright feel. With its soft aftertaste, it is ready to drink now."
"With toasty aromas and flavors, this wine is all about smoky burnt wood, only hinting at a fruity future. Keep it until 2016, although the wood is not going away."
"The wine is perfumed, structured and showing strong wood aging flavors. It lacks fruit, giving a tough character and leaving a highly aromatic aftertaste."
"Light and fresh, this is crisp and ready to drink. With the lightest of tannins, it's more about juicy fruitiness with a bright aftertaste."
This aromatic wine is at the same time structured and tough. Its redeeming feature is the berry fruit layer that is waiting to show through from 2015.
"Red berry fruits are right up front in this juicy, fruity wine without great sense of structure. No matter, it's attractive and fresh now, ready to drink."
"The wine is rounded and soft with attractive berry fruits and wood aging. It's fruity with juicy acidity, black currant freshness and a dry core that will allow it to age 2017-2018."
"This is a wood-laden wine, dense and firmly tannic. It's an unnecessarily tough proposition for a young Bordeaux, but the juicy black currant acidity could bring it round by 2017-2018."
"This offers black currant flavors and firm, stalky tannins. It has acidity, a good juicy character and a dry aftertaste. Drink from 2015."
"A soft, perfumed wine, it shows attractive light black currant flavors as well as some tannins, acidity and a young fruity character. It is ready to drink now."
"A wine that veers between thin and acid and firmer tannins. It lacks the fruit weight to cope with its structure, so the wine will always be lean."
"The wine feels light and very soft. There are some attractive red berry fruits, along with acidity and wood flavors, but the tannic structure is hardly there. It's an enjoyable, lightweight wine to drink now through 2016."
"A soft, rather soapy wine, it displays light fruits and gentle tannins. It is unfocused, with just some juicy aftertaste to give some interest."
"Burnt toast aromas don't exactly make this wine attractive. The palate is better because it has fruit weight, but notes of heavily toasted wood and dry tannins dominate for now. It should improve with age, but will always have this element of hardness."
"Ripe and fruity, this is a simple, easy wine with red berry fruits and soft tannins. It has lively fruitiness that is enjoyable now."
"Structure keeps this firm, dry wine solidly closed. It is tightly wound at this stage, only hinting at a brighter, fruity future. Drink after 2015."
"Burnt toast aromas don't exactly make this wine attractive. The palate is better because it has fruit weight, but notes of heavily toasted wood and dry tannins dominate for now. It should improve with age, but will always have this element of hardness."
"This wine is acidic beyond its other elements. It has a green, herbal character that suggests unripe fruit. It will soften with age, but will always be overtly brisk in nature."
"A balanced wine, showing attractive fruitiness, ripe black currants and soft tannins. It's likely to be ready to drink soon."
"A solid wine, full of dried fruits, dense plums and firm tannins. It has fresh acidity, bright juiciness that will come through more strongly over the next few months."
"A firm, dry wine with good fruit, featuring touches of blackberry along with a solid tannic core. It's a wine for the medium-term, say 2-4 years."
"This wood-aged wine bases its smooth character on firm tannins as much as fruit. It has concentration, firm extraction and a hard edge."
"Light and already fruity, this wine features attractive black-currant flavors, bright acidity and soft tannins. Ready to drink."
"Going more for stalky tannins, this is a youthful, but also austere wine. It has perfumed wood along with hints of black currant tightly encased in a severe outer shell."
"Attractive red fruits and soft tannins make this ripe, lightly structured wine easy to drink. There are hints of herbs and red berry fruits, with a touch of dryness on the finish. Drink now."
"With a blackberry flavor and a juicy character, this is a wine that has a bright, fresh feel and soft tannins."
"This is a toasty, black-currant-fruited wine. Its structural tannins give a dry character. A touch of green herb and a hard edge of toast indicate that the wine needs another year to soften."
"A textured wine, this has ripe fruit that still shows a green, herbal character. It has weight and a ripe black-currant flavor, plus juicy acidity and soft tannins. Ready to drink."
"This exhibits stalky fruit, with some weight behind it. A black currant flavor dominates, with a ripe, jammy feel. For short-term aging."
"This attractive, fruity wine has soft tannins and a texture that is dominated by spice and fruit notes and acidity. It has a juicy red-cherry finish."
"In this toasty wine, the wood smothers the fruit and adds a burnt character. It feels austere, not one to easily reveal its treasures."
"In this hard-edged wine, structure precludes the fruit from surfacing. There is a black currant element, but the tannins are likely to always dominate this firm, austere selection."
"Surprisingly lightweight for the vintage, this is a red fruit-flavored wine, with tannins, acidity and a fresh aftertaste. Not for aging."
"Produced by the largest Bordeaux cooperative, this is a freshly fruity wine, with simple red fruit flavors and soft tannins. There is a smoky edge and pink raspberry acidity."
"Soft, lightweight wine, with gentle tannins and a thin fruit character. There is plenty of acidity to give freshness. Drink now."
Simply fruity Bordeaux. It has signs of wood and black currant fruit along with acidity and a light layer of tannin. Drink now.
"The Chartrons is the neighborhood of Bordeaux where the wine merchants traditionally worked. This branded Bordeaux is softly ripe, with an attractive density along with a dry core of tannins. Ready to drink now."
"Soft, light fruit, packed with red cherries and fresh berries, is the star. The tannins are a mere hint, so the wine should be enjoyed soon for its attractive juiciness."
"This wood-laden wine has light berry fruit and burnt toast flavors. The acidity cuts through, offering a glimpse of stalky black currant flavors."
"Soft, stalky black berry fruits, dry with a firm edge of tannins. The spice shows through along with final acidity."
"Fresh, perfumed wine, with cherry flavors. The acidity is pure, crisp with only light tannins and a green stalky final taste."
"The ludicrously heavy bottle must have cost more than the pleasant, fruity wine inside. The wood aging has had the effect of rounding the red berry fruits, while the juicy acidity points up freshness."
"A ripe, juicy well-made, branded Bordeaux, its tannins tight but just right for the meaty chocolate flavors, spiced with wood. The acidity gives sweetness as much as freshness."
"Light-bodied wine, with fresh spice and stalky tannins. There is bright black currant acidity, giving an edge to the wood perfumes."
"This is an earthy, rustic wine with simple black fruits and acidity. Developing fast, it is ready to drink with its berry flavors, soft tannins and crisp aftertaste."
"A smooth, spice and red-berry flavored wine, this is soft, with an almost sweet aftertaste. It is light, fruity and ready to drink."
"Stalky black currant fruit aromas and a spicy, stalky character on the palate define this tight, dry wine. It's young and tough now, so give it another year and drink from 2018."
"A blend of 65% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc, this is a medium-bodied Bordeaux for everyday drinking. The understated black cherry and cassis fruit does seem a bit lean, but that's the vintage. Tobacco notes mark the finish."
"A simple fruity Bordeaux, attractively layering black currants, firm and dry tannins and fresh, juicy acidity. It's light, already drinkable. Screwcap."
"Solid, wood-flavored tannins give this wine a good, smooth texture. Flavors of red cherries dominate what is an attractively fruity wine."
"A young, very fruity wine produced by Christian Moueix. It is structured, firm and juicy, layered with dry tannins, probably needing 6-12 months of aging. A touch of pepper, red currants, toast and acidity complete this good, very Bordeaux, wine."
"A lean, somewhat austerely tannic wine, with dry tannins. The fruit is subdued, and there are hints of stalky black currant, disappointing from such a famous name. It could work with steak, when the acidity will cut through the meat."
"With plenty of acidity and tannins, this wine is almost trying to be a young red. Drink it like that with food and it will be worth it. The aftertaste has pepper and attractive spice."
"Dark pink in color, this full wine offers tannins as well as crisp red fruits, giving it structure and a firm texture. The wine blends nearly all Bordeaux grapes: Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Drink it chilled, like a Rosé."
"This producer was over-enthusiastic with wood aging. The wine is all about high toast, giving little space for the fruit. That lack of balance may not change."
"This wine holds fruit that was too ripe, giving a clumsy character. It has structure as well as bright acidity, but the wine is spoiled by the jamminess."

A generous use of wood aging has given this wine a caramel flavor that lies awkwardly alongside the berry fruits. The aftertaste is dry.
"This is still a young wine, firm with tannins. The enthusiastic wood aging shows strongly in the smoky toasty flavor. It's hard to find the fruit."
"Layered tannins and wood flavors have tended to smother the fruit in this wine. That gives a dry, tough character not promising much for the future."
"The wine has too much wood. Tannins and spice as well as toast are present, but not enough fruit."
"Situated in the heart of the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers, this estate has a long history dating back to the Middle Ages. With its stalky black currant fruit and acidity, this is fruity with a cool edge and a crisp edge. Drink from 2018."
Strawberry fruit flavors dominate this soft wine. It is unfocussed and misses out on clarity and shape.
A wood-flavored wine that shows high toast and a burnt character. It has acidity and some fruit tannins although the fruit itself is missing. The result is a wine that will end up austere and with too much wood flavor.
"Black currants and spice give this wine its main aromatic character. On the palate, it's light with a dry core that is still dominant. The wine is more about structure and will probably stay that way."
"This wine is structured and stalky without the fruit weight, reflecting the difficult vintage. A smoky character comes through the acidity to leave a dry aftertaste. Through 2016, it will soften a little, although always missing the fruit. The blend is 55% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Ssauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc."
"This is a fruity wine with red berry flavors and fresh acidity. It is crisp, light and ready to drink, with an attractive smoky aftertaste."
"Soft, light and juicy, this is a fresh, strawberry-flavored wine. It has only the lightest tannic structure, with plenty of acidity and bright red fruits. This Ginestet wine is ready to drink."
"While this wine is big on acidity, it does offer ripe, fresh blackberries and currants along with a firmer tannic background. Drink from 2016."
"Smoky aromas lead to a palate with firm tannins and a dry, extracted character. All this masks the fruit for the moment, but let the flavors develop over the next few months, to mid-2016."
"This firm, smoky wine with fine tannins and ripe fruit is developing well, allowing the berry fruits to come through the structure. Give this wine until late 2016."
"Too much extraction has given this wine a dry character. It does have juicy red fruits underneath and these should come out as the wine ages. It is likely, though, always to be a dry wine."
"This wine is tight and austere. It still shows the smoky wood aging that has left a bitter chocolate character in the wine. It should soften, although it will likely end up lean. The blend is 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon."
"Soft, juicy and ready to drink with its berry fruits and rounded tannins, it's an open wine, with only a light tannin character."
"The wine is tough with an obvious wood aging character. At the same time, it has a generous potential, full of ripe black fruits. Together they mean a wine that will need some time, so wait until 2017."
"Tight tannins mark this wine. It does have an attractive red fruit layer, although it feels light on fruit and heavy on tannins."
This structured wine is slow to show its fruity side although it has a layer of acidity with hints of black fruits. It is firm and dry at the moment with dense tannins and a dark aftertaste. Wait until 2017.
"This has a curious caramel aroma from the wood aging. It's tough and extracted, a powerhouse of hard tannins without enough fruit."
"This is fruity, although somwhat direct in character. It has structured tannins and juicy yet indistinct black fruits."
"This is a wine that's on the lean side. That gives it structure without enough fruit to balance. It is dry, tight and shows black currant acidity at the end."
"The 2004 vintage is certainly mature, but with a light touch it is still attractive to drink. Mushroom and spice are lifted by juicy acidity. The dryness at the end shows it is ready to drink."
"This wine feels hard with bitter extraction that detracts from its fruitiness. There is a very dense texture that could soften over time, although bitterness could remain a problem."
"Dry and heavily extracted, this wine has fruitiness that is fleeting. It's a tough wine, but there is just a touch of juiciness on the finish."
"This wine has a lean side that takes away from the bright acidity and fruitiness. With its berry fruit flavors, it should be rich, but lacks a middle."
"With light toast aromas, this is a wine that shows vanilla from wood aging more than its fruitiness. There is a barnyard edge to it that brings out rusticity. On the finish, acidity does bring some freshness."
"A solid and concentrated wine, with burnt wood, bitter extraction and only a hint of blackberry fruit for the long term."
"This dry, darkly tannic wine is all about structure and firmness. It has weight, but the fruit is submerged under the wood and the solid tannins."
"With new wood aromas, this is a toast-dominated wine. The burnt character dominates fruit, leaving a bitter taste. It's likely to remain oaky and dry."
"No Bordeaux should clock in at 15% alcohol, and this wine shows its power in extracted tannins and licorice flavor. Its acidity helps to mitigate the heat, but the flavor of black plum juice is heavier than the structure."
"Should Bordeaux be 14%? Maybe, but not this wine. It is too big, dry, tannin-dominated and heavy. There is way too much extraction, and it shows in the bitter character."
"As its 14.5% indicates, this is a particularly rich wine. Maybe too rich, because it is all superripe black fruit without the balance of structure or acidity. Enjoy it as a blockbuster, probably not with food."
"A dark-hued wine, the tannins from fruit and wood dominating the fruit and giving a tendency to dry out. It could develop, although the tight structure does not help."
"Soft and open fruit, flavors of black currants, rhubarb and fresh acidity. The tannins are light, the wine attractively balanced with a juicy aftertaste."
"A soft, fruity wine lacking great depth, but with attractive red berry fruits and light tannins. It is bright, juicy and ready to drink."
"An austere, stalky wine, showing its dry tannins and woody black currant flavors. It has a bitter edge to it, with its lean, dry tannins."
"Very light, just hinting at tannins, this is an easy, soft wine, the black berry juice fruit flavors the main taste element. The wine has a jammy, smoky character that comes through, but the texture remains dilute."
This wine seems to have superripe fruits that have given it an unbalanced character. It shows acidity and firm tannins but lacks fruit.
"Made from organic grapes, this wine offers red fruits and vibrant acidity with only 8% oak give this wine a light character. Its juicy fruitiness is not fully integrated with the tannins, but that should improve over the next year. Drink from 2020."
"This is a dry wine, firm with tannins and perhaps missing the fruit element. It has a dry core along with acidity. The future will leave it still on the dry side."
"The wine is soft, just juicy and with little in the way of concentration. Barrel-aged for 12 months in one-third new oak, it is attractive and ready to drink now. Vines are planted on limestone and clay above limestone and iron schist subsoil."
This 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon wine is soft and juicy but without much character. Red fruits and acidity leave little more room for development. Aged 12 months in older oak barrels.
"This is a herbal wine with fruit that is firm and austere. It has spice, a touch of wood, berry fruits and dry tannins. It seems on the lean side."
"The wine is ripe, yet with a line of green acidity and touches of bell pepper."
"Smoky aromas from wood aging show again strongly in the tough wooden plank notes that dominate this wine. It's a shame, because the fruit is there."
"Now definitely mature, even drying up, this wine needs to be drunk now. It has developed a dry, tannic character, woody and stalky, although its balance is still there and the aftertaste has some juiciness."
"Rich, but edging toward rustic, with its mature leather and berry fruits, topped by dry tannins. It is firm and smoky, in a very old style."
"This wine is totally dominated by wood flavors, giving a hard, bitter edge that will need several years to soften, if at all. The fruit is hard to discern."
Perfumed new-wood flavors from a variety of toasts are strong in this wine. Tight tannins mask the fruit and probably always will. Less extraction and more fruit would have been good.
"This wine has fruit but it is overwhelmed by the darkly tannic structure. It is concentrated and dense, with signs of extraction giving a hard edge. The Aubert family has been on the Bordeaux Right Bank for two centuries and currently owns six estates. Consulting oenologist is Michel Rolland."
"Firm, tannic and hard, this tight wine has a solid core of dry wood. It seems over-extracted with its bitter coffee flavors. Fruit is hard to come by, although there is weight that could develop."
"This 100% Merlot from a small experimental vineyard is solid, firm and still young. It has a dense structure of tannins and wood aging, showing bitter coffee flavors and an austere character after 14 months in new French oak. It will likely remain a tough proposition."
"With too much smoky toast, this gives a hard, extracted feel with licorice rather than fruit. Tannins are dense and hints of juicy fruitiness only appear in the background."
"A minty, modern style of wine that also has too much extraction and wood tannin for its own good. It's hard edged, the fruit losing out in the process."
"This wine is marked by dry tannins and is smoky and toasty, with little sign of fruit. While it will soften, it will stay somewhat tough."
"Jammy, overripe fruit does not help this wine. Its soft tannins and acidity provide some pleasure, but that clumsy fruit gets in the way."
"Firm tannins and overripe fruit dominate this wine. It will not develop well, with those tannins remaining tough."
"Overripe, jammy fruit aromas and flavors spoil this wine. It's oddly balanced: soft on the one hand and tough on the other."
This wine's strawberry jam aromas lead to a palate dominated by tannins. It's dry and missing fruit.
"This is a ripe, juicy and jammy wine with red plum and soft berry flavors. The name means ""Tame the Beast"" but the wine is not fully balanced and probably will never be."
"This 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc blend has ripe red fruits and soft tannins that give a broad feel. It is ready to drink now."
"A fresh and fruity wine, with black currant notes, yet somewhat stalky in character. The aftertaste is bright and light."
"This is a dark, firm wine, its fruit only showing slowly. The tannins are powerful and dominate the wine. It feels slightly underripe in character."
"This lean wine is high on acidity and structure. The fruit seems to be missing, needing more flesh to feel complete."
"Spicy and oaky, with aromatic notes of plum, cassis and pepper. The snappy palate offers cherry, currant and plum flavors, while the finish is tight-grained and oaky. Although lean and not terribly deep, what's here is largely satisfying."
"The wine is lean for the vintage, tight and with an austere structure. Its tannins and juicy red fruits are in the background. The aftertaste is dry and firm."
The wine has layers of acidity that come from the underripe fruit. It has bell pepper and spice along with red currant fruitiness.
"The wine has the lightness of the vintage. It has spice, red-currant fruits and hints of not-quite-ripe grapes. The wine is developing fast and will be ready from 2017."
"Heavily dominated by wood aging, this wine should be showing its fruit by now, but isn't. It has bitterness, layers of spice and smoky wood. Only the aftertaste brings some freshness and acidity."
"The wine does have fruit, but it is masked by strong burnt tannins from the wood aging. The acidity shows the possibility of red berry fruits appearing later."
"A soapy textured wine that misses any focus. There are soft red berry fruits, gentle tannins and some juicy acidity. But it is just dull."
"Fine-grained tannins course through this wine. It has good juicy currant fruits along with acidity. It feels lightweight, without great concentration, but is certainly immediately attractive."
"An earthy, barnyard wine with soft tannins and red fruits, this is juicy and has plenty of acidity. Drink from 2020."
The wine has very ripe fruit that leaves a jammy character. Merlot sweetness dominates and the wine seems unbalanced maybe the result of recent bottling.
"A hard-edged wine, all bitter tannin and dark extraction. It's hard to tell whether the fruit, if any, will struggle through."
"The wine seems lean, severe with plenty of tannins but not yet enough fruitiness. There are hints of black currants and definitely plenty of acidity. The dry extraction leaves a wine that's gasping for breath."
"Even for the rich 2015 vintage, this is an excessive wine. Made from superripe Merlot with high extraction, it adds dark chocolate flavors to its rich, juicy blackberry jelly fruit, feeling too big and over-the-top."
"A light, juicy and soft wine, it is already drinkable. It has red berry fruits, gentle tannins and acidity. A dry aftertaste comes along with fresh fruits. Drink now."
"Solid, dark and extracted, this hard-edged wine has too many tannins and not quite enough fruit."
"This is a light, fresh and fruity wine, with an attractive red-berry flavor, plus acidity and a soft structure."
"A wine that seems to be all tannin, all wood, with only a feel of black currant fruits underneath all this dryness. These flavors suggest high extraction, giving spice, a high toast wood character, all too much for a delicate 2007."
"This romantically named estate is owned by Emmanuelle and Bertrand Amart. The wine is an attractive mix of spicy, berry fruit and dry tannins, with a measure of fresh acidity thrown in. There is an intriguing smoky finish."
"Densely tannic, this has edgy black currant flavor emerging between a firmly dry structure  packed with dark berry fruits and fresh acidity. This is light in fruit and heavy on tannins."
"Under the same ownership as Château Caronne-Saint-Gemme, this, too is in a soft, ripe style, which would benefit from early drinking. It's attractive, lightly toasty and with good black fruits and acidity."
"La Tour Carnet is a reliable cru bourgeois; this second wine is correspondingly less impressive. The aromas are muted, and the flavors tend toward earthy notes and sour cherries, with rugged tannins on the finish."
"Based in the heart of the Haut-Médoc, this property has produced a wine that shows a dry character, with bitter extraction and too much wood. There are just hints of juicy fruit that will need time to come through. It could well stay dry and firm always."
"A separate Cuvée produced from the vineyard of Château Beaumont, this has an earthy aroma, dense and extracted tannins, and still needs to find its balance. If it is to round out, it will need several years, although it could well remain tough."
"This is a tough wine, packed more with tannins than fruit. A bitter chocolate character comes from over-extraction of the tannins. The fruit is slow in coming, although there are hints of juiciness. Give it until 2017."
"This wine is lean and austere, with extracted tannins that have left no sense of fruit. It will remain hard, although it will be less dry from 2018."
"Closed up and firm, the wine is not showing much in the way of expressive fruitiness. It does have a firm structure, but a taste of bitter extract gives hard tannins and smothers the black currant fruit flavors. In time, it will soften. Drink from 2017."
"The wine is hard, tough and dense. Its tannins are solid, dominant, extracted and cover any fruit. It is likely to remain dry."
"In this light and fruity wine, gentle tannins underlie ripe black currant fruits. It is almost drinkable already, and will age quickly. Drink from 2015."
"A lean wine, hard-edged and with austere tannins. It has some berry fruits that are submerged by the tense tannins and acidity. At the end, smoky wood aging flavors dominate."
"A black currant-flavored wine, it initially feels light and then broadens to give black currant and spice flavors. The tannins give a very dry character, leaving the fruit to struggle. Not for long-term aging; drink from 2016."
"Wood flavors smother the fruit. It has spice, a burnt smokiness and a bitter-chocolate character. The wine does show some juiciness and fresh acidity at the end."
"A hard-edged wine, it's very firm and very dry. It is all structure, showing little in the way of fruit potential."
"An austere, structured wine, this is dominated by strong wood flavors. It has dark chocolate, bitter tannins with the fruit element submerged. At this stage, it doesn't have the weight to fully integrate fruit and structure."
"An austere wine, serious and densely dry. It has some weight and a firm center, with the fruit lagging behind the structure. This is always likely to be tannic."
"A thin wine, with tight stalkiness and smoky, dry tannin flavors. It certainly is fresh, the acidity very marked, black currant fruits bedded into the tannins."
This dense and rich wine is dominated by dark-chocolate flavors of excessive extraction and bitterness. The fruit is hard to find in this wine that will probably remain tough.
"This tastes lean, the fruit buried deep beneath hard, dry fruit tannins. There is an old style austerity here that demands food. The final juicy acidity does leave a welcome relief."
"Lean, soft and soapy in character, this has a dry core and soft tannins, with a lightweight red-berry note. Not for aging."
"A smooth, vanilla-flavored wine that shows good black currant flavors. There are soft tannins, some wood notes, but there is also a stalky dryness in the background. The aftertaste leaves wood and dry fruit in equal proportions. Imported by Wine Frog."
"From one of two properties in Listrac owned by the Thomas family (the other is Reverdi), this is seriously dark and tannic, with flavors of bitter chocolate extract and wood. It doesn't feel as if it will really soften enough."
"The wine is smoky, with black currant-fruits and a core of dry tannins. Those tannins are probably not going anywhere much, so while the fruit and acidity will soften, the wine will always be dry."
"Heavy wood aromas lead to a wine that's dominated by burnt wood with only subdued fruit. It's packed with tannins that are tough and extracted, giving a bitter coffee flavor. Although it will soften, the wine will likely keep its dry, tough character."
"A wine that tries too hard. The extract is strong, giving some bitterness. And, although the berry fruits are sweet and rich, the tannins edge the fruit with hardness. On the finish, some smokiness enhances the black currant juice, but that astringency just won't go away."
"Vineyards in the northern Médoc have produced a wine that while offering some attractive black-currant fruit also has an excess of wood flavors. At this stage, the fruit should be more prominent and the wine possibly will remain toasty and woody."

"Quite minty and herbal, but balanced somewhat by cherry, blackberry and vanilla flavors. A medium-weight quaffer with a fresh, cinnamon note to the finish."
There was a generous use of wood aging here and it shows in the wood and toast flavors. The wine has bitter chocolate as well as black-currant fruits suggesting overenthusiastic extraction.
The wine seems to have too much high-toast wood aging for its own good. This wood has masked the fruit and taken much of the richness of the wine. It could soften and broaden although it will probably remain too dry.
This is an obviously wood-aged wine with plenty of toast flavors. This wood aging has flattened the fruit giving a wine that is soft with few tannins. It is ready to drink.
"Tight and stalky, this wine has smoky red-berry fruits and a strong layer of acidity. Still young, it will certainly soften, although it is likely to remain light and lean. Drink from 2018."
"This stalky, tight wine has a smoky character, lean black-currant fruits and a tough, possibly unripe fruitiness. It is developing fast, drink from 2017."
Too enthusiastic use of wood has left this wine bereft of fruit and unbalanced.
The producer has probably used too much wood for the fruit and density of this wine. The toastiness does not allow any fruit to show through.
"This wine is lean and stalky, with firm, dry tannins that don't give much room for fruitiness. It will be ready to drink from 2017."
"Considerable toasted wood flavors show from both the aroma and the initial taste. The fruit is lean, without the weight needed for balance. It's likely to remain an austere wine."
"Firm and structured, this is a lean and austere wine. It has solid tannins while the juicy acidity and red berry fruits are crisp with hints of green, underripe Cabernet."
"This wine is bottled by the local Médoc cooperative, although it comes from a single estate. With firm tannins and a dense structure, it's austere. The stalky black fruits are only just ripe, giving a green pepper character."
Strong wood aromas continue into the palate of this burnt toast and bitter-chocolate-flavored wine. It is extracted and with a bitter edge. The juiciness from the fruit only emerges slowly and tentatively.
"Gravel and limestone soils provide two different origins for this wine. That said, burnt wood and smoky tannins are the only tastes at the moment. the wine does have enough weight and potential to soften out, so drink from 2017."
This lean wine lacks fruit to support the dry tannins. That probably comes from the extraction that has also caused some bitterness. It's a hard wine that needs time to soften.
"This is dark and firm with a tough, austere character. It has weight, but the bitterness of too-much extraction gives a hard edge. The juiciness at the end doesn't compensate."
"This firmly tannic wine has all the structure of 2010 without the fruit. It's a skeleton without flesh, and it will be unlikely to soften in the coming years."
"This wine has a barnyard flavor, and its black currant fruit shows a bitter edge. The tannins are firm and dry, likely to soften with age."
"An obviously wood-aged wine, this shows a bitter toast character. The fruit is lean, struggling to show through the dark chocolate flavor. It has an austere finish, which is mitigated by its final acidity."
"A wine that is lean and angular, austere, the fruit dominated by very dry tannins. It misses weight with the licorice, meaty flavors and a hard-edged structure."
"Very light, the fruit is soft, easily attractive but rather muted. Flavors are of spice, black figs and stewed plums, the acidity a factor along with the wood."
"A structured wine, full of fresh black berry fruits, red plum skins and fresh acidity. There is a bell pepper element, but the light texture is spiced and rounded with wood."
"Bright red fruits dominate this easy-drinking wine. It has some funky tannins, rustic perhaps, that intrude into the otherwise easy fruitiness of the wine."
"This wine has too much wood for its own good. By now, this should be softening but it is not. There's not enough room for what could be crisp berry fruit. It might soften, but the bitter wood-aging character suggests not."
This tight and mineral-driven wine is still firmly tannic. That core of dryness is likely to remain even while the black-currant fruit matures. Drink this wine from 2019.
"A serious commitment to wood aging has given this wine a dark-chocolate and extracted set of flavors. This masks the wine, which seems almost austere. It will likely remain tough."
"This is lean and structured, with some juicy fruit showing through the bright berries, but also around a core of tannins, acidity, bell peppers and a cool aftertaste."
"A jammy wine it has ripe red berry fruits, soft tannins and a red plum jelly flavor. It will age quickly, so drink from 2016."
"Juicy wine, with very dominant acidity. The flavors are of bright red plums and berries, but the wine lacks depth, skimming the surface of taste."
"Hard around the edges, this wine does have some fruit, but this is masked by the bitter chocolate and burnt tannins. Juiciness surfaces in the aftertaste, but almost as an afterthought."
"Made by the Pauillac cooperative, this is a pleasant, lightweight wine, a surprise considering the vintage. There are black currant flavors, but the wood element is too dominant for the fruit."

"This wine is lean, austere with high acidity that leaves fruit well behind. It is structured and dry, only hinting at black-currant freshness. This third-generation family estate also hosts monthly musical and tasting events and sells fruit, vegetables and honey."
"This wine is not balanced, with wood and acidity opposing each other. It has spice, high toast flavors and stalky black currants. Although it could have potential, it is likely to remain tough. The property is unusual-133 acres in one block."
"This unbalanced wine is caught between acidity and wood. It is hard to see how well this will develop. Owner Francis Boutemy, an inventor, created the ""Bout'mobile"" which glides seated pickers along rows as they cut clusters that are dropped directly into a mobile sorting machine."
"This is a simple, tank-aged wine, without any pretensions to complexity. But it has full, red fruit and licorice flavors, plus good tannins. For the difficult 2002 vintage, this is a good wine. Imported by William Grant & Sons."
"A wine that still shows some youthful tannins, but is maturing well, its freshness subsumed into the red plum and jelly flavors. It is ready to drink now, but should be decanted."
"From a vintage known for its readily-approachable wines, this grand cru Saint-Emilion shows surprising structure. Some toasty oak frames delicate black-cherry fruit. Black tea notes on the finish carry more tannins than the fruit can handle in the long run, so catch this one soon before it heads south."
"The wine suffers from heavy extraction that has left wood rather than fruit. Somewhere in there, the black-currant fruit and acidity are struggling. It will soften, although that wood will remain a problem."
"An oddly balanced wine, showing both light texture and maturity. Spice, beetroot flavors and tense acidity surface, along with a dry aftertaste."
"A burnt-toast, spicy aroma is followed by fresh black currant flavors. This is a light wine, but it is balanced, with the wood fitting well into the fruit. Drink now."
"Already mature, this is a light, mushroom and spice flavored wine. The fruit is now a part of the secondary flavors, a nutmeg sweetness giving some interest. To be drunk now."
"Light and fresh with black currant flavors, this is a simple wine, with attractive, easy fruit, just given weight by tannins and some juicy finishing acidity."
"This Bordeaux from Abarbanel is full of black cherry, root, and oak. All in all it's not bad. Some sweet cherry is at the core, and on the edges you'll find a slight leafiness and some sweet supporting oak. Integrated tannins make the finish smooth. --M.S."
"This is a lean wine that feels to have only structure and very little fruit. There are dry, dense tannins and a firm texture that will only soften marginally."
"Light and fruity, this shows attractive red fruit, ample tannins and acidity. An earthy character to the wine is less pleasant."
"When a Bordeaux wine gets into a heavy bottle, it has something to prove. As here, when the wine has way too much wood and lacks fruit. It could balance out, but that is a long shot."
"A subsidiary label of Chateau Gruaud Larose, obviously destined for earlier drinking than the grand vin. Supple tannins frame cedar, tobacco and earth notes, while the light frame holds just enough flesh to avoid leanness."
"Offers up decent aromas of sour cherries, then folds in leather and earth notes on the palate. This is an easy-to-drink claret for immediate consumption-little tannin, some coffee, tart cherries for balance."
"Bright, fresh wine with a light wood touch. The acidity highlights black currant flavors exacerbated by some greenness."
"A lean wine, with a core of oak, herb and citrus flavors. Briary blackberry, anise and coffee notes add interest, finishing with a tannic bite. Kosher"
"This 100% Merlot is firm, dry and structured. Although the fruit is there, it has been submerged by tannins. Give it a few months for the ripe berry flavors to come through. Drink from 2016."
"This wine's bright purple fruit tastes as if the fermentation has only just stopped. Jammy red berries are laced with some tannins, and acidity freshens the wine, only spoilt by a slight oxidative edge."
"Berry fruits and dense red jelly flavors are the hallmark of this wine. It is full, although edging on stalky, its black berry flavors mixed with acidity and dry tannins."
"This soft wine has a smooth texture and little in the way of tannins. That brings out its red fruit, juicy acidity and light spice notes. Ready to drink."
"Certainly soft, as befits a pure Merlot wine, with smoky tannins and cranberry fruit juice flavors. There is a coolness to the wine, heightened by the acidity, a product of the vintage."
"This structured wine has ripe black fruits followed by red berries. There is a good depth of flavor, the tannins giving the bright fruit weight and a mouthfilling character."
"While there are firm tannins, this wine also has plenty of fresh black currant fruits. Acidity and a crisp texture give it a lift and brightness. Drink this 100% Merlot from 2016 when the tannins have softened."
"That this wine is all Merlot is the reason both for its jammy richness and its high alcohol. It gives a wine that is out of balance, with pepper, spice and wood dominating the super-ripe black cherry fruits. It's unlikely to age for long."
This juicy wine from 100% Merlot suggests overripe fruit. Hints of beets and red berries are shot through with acidity. Drink this jammy wine soon.
"Ripe and jammy, this wine has tannins as well as red-berry flavors. It is unbalanced and seems old-fashioned and hot."
"Turns citrusy and tart on the finish, but this is a decent little claret nonetheless. Smells just right, with cedar, vanilla and cherries combining on the nose, then delivers a light, satiny-smooth mouthful of tart berries and vanilla flavor."
IToo much wood aging has masked the potential of the juicy black fruits of this unusual 100% Petit Verdot wine. It does have weight but that wood is overwhelming.
"Buying branded Bordeaux can be a risky business. But a few of the Bordeaux négociants make some good value brands that also offer decent quality. This is one of them. From the great 2000 vintage, it is ripe, lively and fresh, but at the same time has some depth of flavor with red fruits, a layer of wood and the acidity that makes red Bordeaux great with rich foods."
"This wine is all about dryness, with hard-edged fruit and firm tannins."
"The wine, with its dry tannins, is dense while unfocussed. It will remain tannin dominated."
The wine smells of over-ripe fruit and this sensation continues through the palate. The fruit and the tannins don't coincide.
This wine has fresh acidity and attractive black currant fruit flavors. They are given a hard ride by the dark and bitter tannins and dry texture. This is a Carreau family wine.
"Vanilla and caramel flavors dominate this wine after 12 months in French oak. That means that the fruit is really not allowed to shine. It is firm, very dry and all about spice. A pepper flavor from the alcohol leaves a burn in the mouth."
"The over-exuberance of wood aging spoils this wine. With strong spice and equally tannic elements, it's all about the skeleton and not about the flesh of the fruit."
"The wine is ripe and soft with a body of tannin that sits uneasily within this jammy character. The blend (Merlot 75%, Cabernet Franc 25%, Malbec 5%) was aged 30% in barrel and 70% in stainless steel tanks. It is unbalanced and likely to remain so."
Juicy and spicy flavors give a wine that layers fruit and ginger. Blackberries are the dominant fruit while the spice adds a bite that is almost exotic.
"This soapy, unfocused wine has tannins and red berry fruit but little structure. The fruit shows a green streak that will not improve."
"The fruity, perfumed character shows instant red berry aromas, but the old-wood flavor doesn't quite chime with the fruit, giving a slightly muddled feel to the wine."
"Mint aromas speak of the wood used in aging this wine. With some burnt tannin character, it's perhaps not a wine that will show great fruit."
"Earthy aromas are an off-putting start to this heavily tannic wine. It tastes bitter and extracted, the fruit worked too hard during fermentation."
"Very dry and hard, with lean black currant fruits. This is likely to remain a tough and extracted wine."
"This wine has an unusual candy-flavored character. Its tannins are fine, and there is structure, but the final character is unbalanced."
"A firm and tannic wine, with a hard-edge feel to it. The structure is dry and tough, leaving little room for the fruit, even in the future."
This wine has meaty aromas that lead into a bacon flavors. It has ample tannins but hardly any fruit.
Dark chocolate and spice dominate this tough wine. The structure and extraction have smothered the fruit. Aging will be a hard call.
"This soft, lightly tannic wine suggests red berries and a touch of spice. The wine is open and ready to drink."
"This shipper's blend is plump yet structured, boasting an herbal lattice of flavors draped over a base of black cherry and berry. Modest tannins and firm acidity provide grip to the finish"

"There are aromas of ripe, juicy fruit. To taste, the wine is soft, juicy, and easy, perhaps slightly dilute. A very approachable wine, but in the end lightweight."
"This is a dry wine, more about structure than fruit. The tannins and the firm extraction shows strongly. It is not enjoyable."
This is a wine that has been spoiled by the over-use of wood aging. The fruit is still struggling to come through. It will be a tough call as to which wins.
"Light and unfocused, this simple wine has fruit but misses out on structure and much interest."
"It is a tough wine with too much wood for the fruit. Wood aromas show strongly in the taste as well. Some balance will come, but probably not enough."
"The wine is dry, firm and initially tough. With its dry wood core, the fruit is not getting a chance."
"This fresh wine has plenty of acidity as well as some firm tannins. It is still young, waiting to fill out with riper fruit flavors. The aftertaste just repeats the acidity."
"Tannins mask the light fruitiness in this blend of 45% Merlot, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc. It seems extracted, with the producer attempting to get too much out of the fruit in a lean year."
"This 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc blend is very fruity and fresh, balancing dry tannins and attractive red fruit flavors. It is light, still tight with its structure. Drink from 2016."
"A light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. From the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region, it has red berry fruits and juicy acidity. A greener, herbal character in the background suggests grapes that weren't totally ripe at harvest."
This is a thin wine with way too much acidity for the fruit. The rest of the wine is dry tannin that could soften into a more juicy character. It's always going to be a light wine.
"Herbal aromas give a crisp character. The fruit is not entirely ripe, so the wine relies on its tannins and acidity to get balance."
"This is a structured wine, with too many tannins from wood and fruit. The red berry fruits are likely always to remain second to the structure."
This is a lean wine that seems to be missing the fruit. It has an austere quality with a strongly tannic element and mineral acidity.
"Ripe and juicy, this smooth, simple wine is ready to drink. Juicy black currant fruits are polished by the wood aging."
"A juicy wine, it has soft tannins and gently stalky fruit textures. Black currant fruits accompany fresh, tangy acidity. Not for aging, so drink now."
"This wine seems rather unfocused with indistinct tannins and fruit. There is a soapy texture, and the red berry fruits seem awash with acidity."
"There is way too much acidity here, and it's exagerrated by the wine's soft, unfocused texture. Notes of bitter toast and dark tannins are rather unbalanced."
"Dry, firmly structured and tough, this is an austere wine that doesn't hold out much hope for improvement. Drink it soon with rich food to balance out its dense tannins and wood flavors."
"Very young, fruity wine. The tannins are already soft and there is stalky black currant acidity that gives the wine a bright freshness. It has no wood and will develop fast."
"Dry and tannic initially, the wine opens up to reveal a soft, fruity character. It is still compact, with some bitterness from overextraction."
"This lightweight wine is dominated by juicy red fruit. Fresh in character, it has bright acids and soft tannins. Not a wine for aging."
"This perfumed wine is tough on the palate. It has a firm, dry core, surrounded by red-currant-driven acidity. The finish is out of balance."
"This is a dense, wood- and tannin-laden wine. It's hard, with a dry and unyielding structure. In one year, it should be more generous."
"This has a tight, severe character, with black currant fruit and a touch of green bell pepper. It's stalky and structured, with a lean feeling."
"A tight wine-this is on the lean side, but shows an attractive red-currant flavor and soft tannins. This is not meant for aging."
"Taut, stalky wine, very structured. There is fruit but it is herbal, green, missing ripeness. The tannins have the same character."
"Very soft wine, with gentle berry fruit flavors, cinnamon and a light, ripe character. Black currant fruits emerge from the light texture with an attractive tannic layer."
"This soft, wood- and blackberry-flavored wine shows spice alongside acidity. It has an edge of astringency and green herbs, but the vanilla from the wood does give it some weight and balance."
"Lean, initially bitter, this is a firmly tannic wine. The berry fruits show freshness, but the dry tannins dominate. Of course, it's young, but the texture is too light for much development."
"A stalky Bordeaux from a vineyard north of Saint-Emilion. The fruit is austere and lean, with plenty of acidity. There are light tannins, and there is fresh fruit, but the core is missing."
"Vanilla aromas and fresh red currant fruit flavors give this wine a freshness as well as a simple, easy structure. The acidity could be less dominant."
There is a Rosé here struggling to get out. This wine has strawberry fruits combined with tannins in a way that does not work. Bordeaux Clairet lies between Rosé and red in color and in taste.
"Closed and tough, this wine has spent too long in wood. It offers little but spice and toast."
"High-toast flavors still dominate this wine, although they should by now have melded into the fruit. It suggests the wine will continue to have strong, bitter wood flavors."
"This wine is spoiled by overripe fruit. It has a juicy component as well as firm tannins, but that high-alcohol jammy character is not pleasant."
"lean, austere wine, that has dry tannins and flavors of stalky currants. It is pleasant enough, with some freshness, but there is a definite green element to it."
This tough wine has overripe fruit. There are tough extracted tannins. It's a hard wine to like.
The wine has a southern character with very ripe fruit that seems unbalanced for the tannins and acidity. It's an odd wine.
The wine is tight and perhaps firm. Its extracted tannins and dry core are too much for the fruit.
Smoky aromas lead to a wine that is dominated by wood. It is about structure rather than fruit.
"The wine is dominated by extracted wood flavors. It is likely to soften, but not enough to allow the fruit to sing."
The wine is smoky and toasty. It is extracted with bitter coffee flavors that dominate the fruit. Too much burnt wood will leave little room for fruitiness.
"This wine is soft, full in the mouth while not having much focus."
"Toast aromas precede layers of wood flavors that give the wine a tough, dry, spicy character that masks the fruit."
"With soft tannins and fresh fruits, this light, crisp wine has a red fruit-flavored character that is intense in its acidity. Drink now."
"There is probably too much wood aging in this wine. It's still young, but the dominant toastiness gives a burnt character. It has a hard edge, tough and very dry."
"This is hard and tough, all tannins and extraction."
This tough wine seems light on fruit. It is hard and shows considerable extraction.
"With a high proportion of Cabernet in the blend, this holds tough tannins. There is also juicy Merlot that offers an attractive, fruity future."
"The fruit is extremely extracted, making for a wine that is tough, very firm and hard without the juicy character needed to see it through."
This is a hard-edged wine with a chemical character. It's tough both in tannins and extracted fruits.
"Bread and yeasty aromas lead to a wine that has tannins and wood aging, leaving the fruitiness behind."
"Bitter extraction hinders this wine. It does have some attractive fruitiness in the background, but it's lost amidst all the toughness. The rigid edge will soften, although the wine's fruitiness may well never materialize."
"This wine is too toasty for its own good. It has dark tannins, high spice and bitter toastiness. There is a soapy aftertaste that only just hints at fruit."
"Juicy and fruity, this wine has strong layers of acidity and extracted tannins. It has a hard, austere character that doesn't promise for the future."
"This dark, extracted wine is firm in character. It has bitter coffee and licorice flavors, which rather elbow aside the fruit."
"A hard and tannic wine, with too much dryness for pleasure. It's not likely to soften enough to balance out."
"Hard and extracted, this wine shows little more than tannins. The fruitiness is hard to discern and may never come through."
"This is all fruit and no structure. The fruit shows a superripe character, which suggests this is a wine for short-term aging."
"This warm wine is reminiscent of vintage Port. It is sweet, with dominating nut and superripe fruit flavors. It's soft and gently flabby."
"Juicy and fruity, this has ripeness without much structure. This is for early drinking."
"This is a lightweight wine with fruit that tastes overripe. It has a soft, fruity texture, and its gentle tannins are touched by acidity."
"Attractively made, but uncomplicated wine, with fresh raspberries, acidity, a light tannic coating, maybe spoilt by a rustic edge. Drink now."
The wine suffers from over-ripe fruit that give it a red-jelly flavor. The tannins and acidity make an odd contrast.
"Strong wood flavors have smothered the fruit, leaving vanilla, spice and milk chocolate as the main flavors. Gérard Laurent blends 65% Cabernet Franc and 35% Malbec from biodynamic and organic vineyards in egg-shaped Apollo flexitanks where the wine matures for a year."
Heavy toast aromas follow through to a wine that is packed with new wood and some fruit. It has a biting burnt edge that may soften.
"A confected wine that shows polished wood and mint flavors but little fruit. It puts on a great show, but without depth."
"Lean and tough, this is all hard edges. The wine has an austere character that's likely to be off-putting even in the future."
"Simple, light and leafy. Not a lot of oomph here. Some light, dry raspberry fruit and plenty of wood on the palate and finish. You gotta love your oak to really enjoy this one. It's kind of closed, and I wouldn't bet much on its future."
This dark wine has extracted tannins and dark-coffee flavors. Its hard edge is probably not going to soften enough.
"This lean wine, all acidity and tannins, has a severe character that is not likely to go away. The estate has been handed down from mother to daughter for seven generations and now owned by enologist Marie Laure Latorre. It was named for the Merlot plot planted on 08/11/99, the date of the last total solar eclipse seen in France."
"There is a strongly rustic character to this wine. The fruit seems to have disappeared. and the wine is tough right through. Maceration took place in traditional concrete vats; malolactic fermentation and aging in barrels, 25% new oak."
"With no added sulfites and from organically grown grapes, this bottling ventures into natural wine territory. However, it suffers from a tinny character that can affect these wines and shows some hints of volatility. The second bottle tasted was less volatile."
"Soft, ripe and jammy, this is too ripe and misses structure. Its acidity does redeem it, but it is not going to develop much."
"This is a spicy wine, soft and open. Its tannins and red berry fruits have a diffuse character that takes away the focus of the wine. It will age quickly."
"Very dry and with too much wood, this is an attenuated wine with a hard facade. It doesn't offer enough fruit for the future."
"This wine veers between firm tannins from old wood and red fruit acidity, without finding balance. It's very dry, with a hard edge."
"A lean, somewhat austere wine that emphasizes tight tannins and minerality. The fruit is firm, but at the same time both slightly oxidized and edging towards green. The result is a set of flavors that definitely demands food."
"While this wine shows some of the softness and richness of 2003, it keeps a light touch and the acidity and black fruits remain fresh. There is an edge of astringency that leaves a hard aftertaste."
"This wine is all structure and dark, dry tannins. The fruit is very subdued, giving a hard wine that could well remain tough."
"A very juicy wine that shows overripe fruit and an herbal character. It's soft, fruity without great definition and likely to develop quickly."
"Juicy but not quite ripe, this is a green and herbal wine that is not worth aging. Drink it over the next few years."
"With barnyard aromas, this is a rustic wine. It does have some red fruit flavors and acidity but these are compromised by the earthy texture."
"This wine is fruity but has a lean texture that emphasizes tannins rather than fruit. With a dry core and bitter-chocolate flavors, the wine misses out on the fruit."
"Spicy, foresty aromas dominate what subdued fruit there is. The palate is tight and grippy, with full-on tannins that really get after your cheeks. Amid those tannins is some grapey fruit and a bit of toastiness."
"Starts off with an herbal note that carries throughout. Blackberry, cassis, tar, spice and citrus flavors are in evidence as well. Tannins are a bit rustic. Kosher"
"Lean and tannic, this wine has chocolate and bitter coffee flavors from over-extraction. The fruit is suppressed at this stage, with a bitter aftertaste."
The wine is stalky with a green element that suggests underripe fruit. Black currant competes with burnt flavors that will soften as the wine ages. Drink from 2017.
"Earthy aromas need time to blow away once this is opened. After that, the wine gives lean fruit, a tight and mineral stalkiness and high acidity. Bitter extraction cuts through the wine."
"This is a special selection from parcels of vines in Château Castéra. Stewed plum aromas lead to a wine that is lean, leaving little room for the fruit."
"A rather soapy, wine, it does not have enough fruitiness to sustain its tannins. It's hard edged and likely to remain that way."
"Dry and light, an unfocused wine. It has tannins, only light fruit, very dry and ultimately tough."
"Shows its Right Bank roots in Merlot and Cab Franc-derived red fruit and herb flavors: strawberry, tomato and rhubarb. Turns leathery and earthy, with some hints of toast on the finish."

A thin wine that is all dry tannins and not enough fruit. It is lightweight with just a hint of juiciness.
"Definitely on a downward slope, this wine is very dry, the fruit gone and replaced by tannins. Drink now. Imported"

"This has plenty of tannins, but seems thin on the fruit. It gives an unbalanced wine that should have filled out by now. The texture is extracted with a hard edge."
"A very dry, tannic wine, full of dense structure. The fruit can be found underneath all this dryness, a layer of hedgerow blackberries, tight and firm. At the end, there is some baked acidity."
"A hard, too-toasty wine that is completely dominated by smoky wood flavors. Whatever fruit is there is swamped, only a juicy hint through the wine's weight."
"Lean and earthy, but clean, and with an appealing freshness. Cherry and berry fruit dominates, and the finish is true. And there's even some patented Bordeaux herbaceousness, but in a good way. Kosher."
"This Kosher Bordeaux has woody, maple-like aromas along with some smoky, rubbery accents. The palate offers some cherry and cola flavors, while the finish is smooth enough, with pronounced woody notes."
"This is a light 100% Merlot wine, with tangy red berry fruits. Tight and mineral with high levels of acidity, it is not for aging, so drink now."
Overripe fruit from a small experimental vineyard is the hallmark of this wine. The awkwardness is not helped by the extracted tannins.
"Aromas of maple, black pepper and cherry cough drop get it going in a fair to midland direction. The palate is basic, with only some standard berry fruit and oak, while the finish is lengthy and easy, but also kind of mute. In terms of mouthfeel, some hard tannins prevent it from falling into the ""friendly"" category."
"This wine has too much tannin for its own good. It's tough and bitter, showing wood and extraction. In this difficult Bordeaux vintage, the vineyard produced less than half what is normal."
"The wine is all toast and smoky wood flavors though it spent only six to eight months in oak. It is extracted and hard, with little fruit."
"Overripe, jammy fruits and dry tannins are an odd combination. They don't work in this wine that has a hot character. This is the first vineyard in Blaye certified by Terra Vitis for sustainable viticulture."
"A diffuse wine without focus. The tannins and the fruit are some way apart, while the final flavor is dry and tough."
"Bell peppers and green herbs as well as dark tannins are the main characters of this very dry, bitter wine."
"This unfocused wine has hard tannins and a firm structure. What's missing is the fruit, which may not come through."
"I know Bordeaux isn't known for being fruit-driven, but this paucity of fruit in a wine that's 50% Merlot (from a vintage that favored this variety's development) is hard to fathom. Leather and old wood combine with earth and mushrooms. There's decent weight and intensity here, so if these are flavors you look for this is an example to seek out."
"The wine is dry, laden with wood flavors rather than fruit. It has a hard over-extracted edge that will stay with the wine as it ages."
This is an unfocused wine with fruit flavors that miss the mark. Only the juicy aftertaste is attractive.
This is a tight woody wine that is hard and over-extracted. Some fruit may come through but it is hard to imagine.
"You need to work hard to find the fruit in this 100% Merlot. It is tough, only hinting at acidity and black currant flavors."
Dry tannins and wood flavors give a hard character. It's tough to see beyond the wine's dryness and find the fruit.
Crisp fruitiness and acidity show the fruit is not ripe. It's a herbal and stalky.
"While this wine is still young, the level of smoky wood aging flavors is enormous. It's all about planks and not about fruit, not taking into account the light vintage. Could the black fruits develop? Certainly, but maybe not enough."
"This is a wine that is totally dominated by wood. So much so that there is little sign of fruit. Maybe it will integrate, but there is a question mark."
"Overripe fruit makes this wine, which is light and fruity, with little structure."
"This firm, dry wine is all tannins and bitter extraction. It has a hard side to it that the juicy fruit cannot balance."
"Fruity and without structure, this wine is soft and feels rather dilute. The red fruits dominate and will age quickly. Screwcap."
"Dry, dark-hued tannins cut through the wine, giving it a bitter feel. It is tough, firm, missing the balancing fruit."
"Indulgent wood and high toast flavors swamp the fruit here. The result is a wine that is lean, hard-edged and without the weight to develop."
"A simple, fruity wine, the fruit on the lean side, with black currant flavors and fresh berry acidity. There is an unfortunate rustic edge to the tannins."
"A tight, firmly tannic wine. It does show pleasing berry fruits, and it has freshness, but the acidity is very apparent, and courses through the fruit and tannins. The finish is tart black currant. Screwcap."
"A raw-edged wine, with dusty tannins and blackberry fruits and sawdust wood flavors that don't quite gel, and some green asparagus flavors to finish."
"The toffee aromas of this wine are followed by an unbalanced character of Clairet on the palate. Dry and not very fruity now, it will probably remain like this."
The acidity that is a characteristic of the vintage shows through in this wine. It clashes with the tannins to give a strangely unbalanced wine.
"High levels of acidity give this wine a tight, eye-watering character. The fruit was probably not ripe."
"This wine is dry, firm with chocolate and bitter extraction flavors. It's likely to remain dry."
"Hard and extracted, this is a tough number. The fruit seems lean and the bitter chocolate flavor is not promising much. It may work with food."
"The unfocused wine tastes soapy, with bitterness and little fruit. Not a wine to enjoy now or in the future."
"There is an awkwardness to this wine, coming from the overripe fruit and juicy character. It lacks structure and will likely age quickly."
"A meat-flavored wine without much charm, this has tannins and red berry notes, along with a strong whiff of sulfur."
"This is bizarrely perfumed: It tastes like a candy shop smells, with a note of fruit jelly. The tannins are taut, but the wine doesn't hang together."
"On the lean side, this wine has an intense black-currant flavor and acidity, producing a wine that tastes mean and is not likely to age."
"The fruit seems overripe, with a juicy character. A core of tannins balances the palate, and a meaty flavor creeps in on the finish."
"Heavily wooded wine, so dry, with the fruit lost in all the burnt toast character. It's all too much for the fresh style of 2008."
"A Merlot-dominated wine, soft, fresh, the tannins a whisper under red berry fruits. This simple freshness is spoilt by a dirty edge to the acidity, giving a final bitterness."
A lean wine with some austerity. It has a firmly tannic character while missing the fruit for the future.
"This old-vine wine shows signs of rotten fruit, certainly aromatically. On the palate, it is tight with dark tannins and a hard, extracted edge. It is hard to tell if it could soften. This property liess in both the Castillon and Franc appellations. Wine is vinified plot by plot."
This wine has a jammy character with acidity that is unbalanced. Wine is made in cement tanks and aged in cement tanks and new and up to three-year-old French oak barrels.
"The new wood and spice flavors still show in this wine. A dry, woody character is still keeping the fruit back. Black coffee flavors show that there was heavy extraction. This 20-acre property is one of four in the greater Saint-Émilion area owned by the Lannoye family."
A lean and underweight wine. It has some juicy fruit but it misses depth of flavor.
"Rustic, barnyard aromas with flavors of hedgerow red berries and light acidity. The style is fruity; the sweet fruits are shot through with some licorice and beetroot flavors."
"An over-oaked wine. The lean 2007 fruit cannot cope with the wood, resulting in a wine that is one-dimensional."
"All tannin, this wine is missing fruit, although the acidity hints at some fading freshness. It is tough and dry, not offering much real pleasure."
"Mature Bordeaux from a not very good vintage. It is drying up, the flesh gone, just the bare bones of tannin remaining."
"Olive and pickle notes run on top of the fruit on the nose, while more olive character along with coffee and black fruit carry the palate. Vibrancy is not this wine's calling card; it's more dark, earthy and ultimately kind of flat."
"Red cherry aromas lead to a wine that is curiously structured with firm tannins and jammy fruit that is not in balance. ""Natur"" means the winemaker did not add sulfites during wine production."
"Aromas and flavors of rhubarb and red pepper dominate, resulting in a wine that is sharp and unbalanced."
"This is very light, in both flavor and body. The aromas are earthy, with a faint suggestion of blackberries, and the mouthfeel is thin. These aren't terrible flaws, but the wine just lacks substance."
"This is very light, in both flavor and body. The aromas are earthy, with a faint suggestion of blackberries, and the mouthfeel is thin. These aren't terrible flaws, but the wine just lacks substance."
"This wine has been too heavily extracted, giving a series of tough tannins and a hard edge without the fruit to balance things out. It is a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25/25 Merlot and Cabernet Franc."
"Meat and bacon aromas lead to a dry, tannic wine. It only hints at a fruity future."
This is an unfocused wine that has jammy fruit and soft tannins. It tastes overripe. Not for aging.
"Meat and bacon aromas introduce a wine that is taut, structured and high on the acidity. It has a lean, slightly dirty taste, which is not attractive."
"A lean, rather attenuated wine. It has some pleasant red fruits, but is too dilute. Drink now, while the fruit is still fresh."

"This wine has too much extraction to allow the fruit to develop. It will soften out, although not enough. It is an 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend."
"A southern yet herbal-feeling wine, this is ripe-maybe overripe-and missing real structure or fruitiness."
"This wine's fruit is overripe, which spoils the structure that has been built around it."
"This wine is all wood, with no promise of fruit."
"While there is plenty of wood here (12 months in new barrels), the raisin character of the 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon gives it a curious, dried-fruit flavor."
"All dry tannin and bramble aromas, this wine is a tough proposition. François Maurin and son Raphael handle the organic vineyards and wine fermented in stainless steel."
"A hard, very firm, lean wine, showing structure and tannins but little in the way of substance. Old-style winemaking produces an old style wine."
"Already showing signs of aging, this is hard, dry and tough. Not much pleasure there."
"The nose features some plum and faint cedar aromas, but not a lot of intensity; the light black-cherry and cedar flavors incorporate some earthy nuances on the finish. Light and correct, but where's the beef?"
"Weak cherry and cassis aromas are followed by dilute raspberry flavors. The finish is tangy and borderline thin, while the overall impression is sharp and tart. Despite all that it tastes fresh, not tired. Kosher."
"Mushroom and plum aromas followed by coffee and black plum flavors. Hot, heavy and over the top."
This very ripe wine tastes of supermature grapes; it' s soft and formless.
"Lean and rather dry, this has old wood and lean fruit flavors."
"The problem with this wine is the wood. There is too much of it, and the toasting is too high, giving a burnt character to the wine. For a 2005, this should be better integrated, and is likely to just dry out."
"Earthy, with little fruit. The flavors are thin and much like strawberry infused tea. Acidic and dry. Barely acceptable."
"Remember that old TV commercial asking, ""Where's the beef?"" You can apply that here. It smells fresh enough, and there's cranberry-styled tart fruit backed up by oak. But it's way short on soul and stuffing. No need to hold this; drink it now for what fruit there is. Made from 75% Merlot."
"Husky and muddled, with less than precise plum and berry flavors. The flavor profile doesn't sing and the finish is lean, drying and even a touch bitter at its culmination."
"Green and underripe, with tobacco and rhubarb aromas. The flavors are too weedy and burnt for the wine to merit higher, and that's despite a perfectly good mouthfeel. Kosher."
"Horsey and heavy in the nose, with some cinnamon sweetness. The fruit is big and overstuffed, like plum pie. There's also a burnt flavor and potent acidity."
